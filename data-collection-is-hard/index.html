<a href=https://counting.substack.com/p/go-collect-some-and-data>overtures by a few valiant data
professionals</a><sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>.</p><p>With this blog post I want to give a defense of data collection — not as an
activity that&rsquo;s inherently worthwhile pursuing (I assume data professionals
don&rsquo;t need to be convinced of that!), but as something that is worth doing even
for <em>selfish</em> reasons. Why should you spend time learning about that data
collection system that&rsquo;s being maintained by that other team at work? Why
should you consider collecting some data for your next side project? <em>What&rsquo;s
in it for you?</em></p><p>Throughout this blog post, I’ll be making comparisons to a recent project of
mine, <a href=https://cryptics.georgeho.org/><code>cryptics.georgeho.org</code></a>, a dataset of
cryptic crossword clues which I created and published last year.</p><h2 id=learn-data-adjacent-technologies>Learn Data-Adjacent Technologies</h2><p>The most obvious reason is that <strong>collecting data is a unique opportunity to
learn many staple technologies in data</strong> &mdash; and there aren&rsquo;t many projects
that run the entire data tech stack.</p><p>To enumerate these technologies:</p><ol><li>Compute services<ul><li>Your data collection pipelines will need to run somewhere. Will that be in
the cloud, or on your local computer? How do you think about trading off
cost, compute and convenience?</li><li>I ran most of my web scraping on DigitalOcean Droplets, but I could just
as easily have taken the opportunity to learn more about cloud compute
solutions or serverless functions like AWS EC2 or Lambda. These days, the
project runs incremental scrapes entirely on my laptop.</li></ul></li><li>Data storage<ul><li>You’ll need to store your data somewhere, whether it be a relational or
NoSQL database, or just flat files. Since your data will outlive any code
you write, careful design of the data storage solution and schema will pay
dividends in the long run.</li><li>I used SQLite for its simplicity and performance. However, as the scope of
the project expanded, I had to redesign the schema multiple times, which
was painful.</li></ul></li><li>Labeling, annotation or other data transformations<ul><li>After collecting your data, you may want to label, annotate, structure or
otherwise transform your data. For example, perhaps you’ll want to pull
structured tabular data out of unstructured PDFs or HTML tag soups;
another example might be to have humans label the data.</li><li>This is the main “value-add” of your dataset &mdash; while the time and effort
required to collect and store the data constitutes a moat, ultimately what
will distinguish your dataset to <em>users</em> will be the transformations done
here.</li><li>For me, this involved a lot of <code>BeautifulSoup</code> to parse structured data
out of HTML pages. This required a <a href=https://cryptics.georgeho.org/datasheet#collection-process>significant amount of development and
engineering
effort</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Data licensing and copyright<ul><li>Once you have your dataset, can you license, share or even sell your data?
The legality of data are a huge grey area (especially if there&rsquo;s web
scraping involved), and while navigating these waters will be tricky, it&rsquo;s
instructive to learn about it.</li><li>I feel like the collection and structuring of cryptic crossword clues for
academic/archival purposes was fair use, and so didn&rsquo;t worry too much
about the legality of my project — but it was an educational rabbit hole
to fall down!</li></ul></li><li>Sharing and publishing data<ul><li>The legal nuances of data aside, the technical problem of sharing data is
pretty tricky!</li><li>This problem sits at the intersection of MLOps and information design: you
want to share the data in a standardized way, while having an interface
that making it easy for users to explore your data. Serving a tarball on a
web server technically works, but leaves so much on the table.</li><li><code>cryptics.georgeho.org</code> uses <a href=https://datasette.io/>Datasette</a>, which I
can&rsquo;t recommend highly enough.</li></ul></li><li>Writing documentation<ul><li>If you think it&rsquo;s hard to write and maintain good documentation for
software, imagine how difficult it must be to do the same for data, which
outlives software and is much harder to both create and version control.</li><li>I&rsquo;ve found <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010>Gebru et al.&rsquo;s <em>Datasheets for
Datasets</em></a> to be an excellent template
for documenting data.</li></ul></li></ol><h2 id=design-a-data-collection-system>Design a Data Collection System</h2><p>Hopefully by now you can appreciate that every part of the data collection
pipeline involves not just technical proficiency with some system or framework,
but also an element sound architecture.</p><p><strong>Collecting data is a great way to get experience designing an entire data
pipeline from end to end, from creation to delivery.</strong> This kind of opportunity
doesn&rsquo;t come easily (even in industry!), and while your data pipeline won&rsquo;t be
as sophisticated as the kinds you&rsquo;ll find at data companies, you&rsquo;ll still be
able to take away some valuable lessons from it.</p><p>For <code>cryptics.georgeho.org</code>, I found that the most valuable pattern for storing
data was to dump raw and unstructured data into a database (a &ldquo;data lake&rdquo;), and
then extract useful and structured data into a separate database (a &ldquo;data
warehouse&rdquo;). I also learnt that the historical backfilling ETL job required a
lot of time and compute, but subsequent incremental ETL jobs could just run off
of my laptop. These best practice patterns around data collection and
management are all applicable far beyond my simple side project, and were
valuable lessons to learn first-hand.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Puzzlingly, this trend doesn&rsquo;t seem to be true of other forms of
