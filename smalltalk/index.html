recommendation</a>, I
decided to pick up <em>Smalltalk: Best Practice Patterns</em> by Kent Beck. I
initially was pretty skeptical of the book: it sounded like a book on Smalltalk
&mdash; not exactly something I know much about (in either sense of the word :P).
But people seemed to be giving it rave reviews on Twitter (just click around
the replies on Avi&rsquo;s quoted tweet!), so I decided to give it a shot.</p><p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about Smalltalk. Smalltalk is an <em>extremely</em> influential
language with a <a href=https://hackernoon.com/back-to-the-future-with-smalltalk-57c68fab583a>storied
history</a>.
It was the progenitor of so many ideas that we now take for granted. IDEs.
Test-driven development. The
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller>model-view-controller</a>
architecture pattern. Language virtual machines. JIT compilation. I can&rsquo;t
possibly do its legacy justice here, so I&rsquo;ll just focus on one thing.</p><p>Smalltalk was the first <em>purely objected oriented</em> language: the phrase
&ldquo;everything is an object&rdquo; started with Smalltalk. Objects can have <em>methods</em>,
and communicate to each other via <em>messages</em>. This fastidiousness makes it
difficult to translate the book&rsquo;s lessons into Python: most popular languages
today aren&rsquo;t as strict as Smalltalk (i.e. not everything has to be
encapsulated in a object), so I mentally substituted &ldquo;message&rdquo; with &ldquo;function&rdquo;,
and most of the best practice patterns still seemed to make a lot of sense.
However, I&rsquo;m not totally sure that this is the best way to translate it.
Smalltalkers please chime in!</p><p>Despite what the book&rsquo;s title might suggest, I would say that this book is
about <em>best practice patterns</em> &mdash; design decisions that are made repeatedly by
experienced developers and are generally (but not universally!) helpful &mdash;
that happen to be <em>illustrated</em> in Smalltalk. In other words, the most
important lessons of the book are language-agnostic.</p><p>At first, I was actually a bit underwhelmed by this book, since it seemed to be
explaining a lot of patterns that I already seemed to know, and I was hoping to
learn more patterns: perhaps my code sucked because I was just shooting myself
in the foot by structuring it wrong!</p><p>Instead, the book focussed on a lot of patterns that I had already seen in
various Python libraries/APIs. It devoted a lot of time to explaining what
problems these patterns solved, what kind of trade-offs they made, and when not
to use these patterns. It forced me to think critically about the patterns I
had already seen (instead of teaching me new patterns) and convinced me to
double down on following these best practices patterns in my code.</p><p>Here are some best practice patterns that I found interesting and
well-explained:</p><ol><li><p>The pattern of <strong>using classes as functions</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>How do you code a method where many lines of code share many arguments
and temporary variables?</p><p><em>Create a class named after the method. Give it an instance variable for
[&mldr;] each argument and each temporary variable [&mldr;] Give it once instance
method, <code>compute</code>, implemented by copying the body of the original method.
Replace the method with one which creates an instance of the new class and
sends it <code>compute</code>.</em></p></blockquote><p>This practice pattern immediately reminded me of <code>scikit-learn</code>&rsquo;s API,
which exposes machine learning algorithms as classes with a <code>.fit()</code> and
<code>.predict()</code> methods. This design made sense to me (there is generally some
state that needs to be saved after training, and a class is the right way
to encapsulate that state), but struck me as a bit unsettling. Most classes
are nouns, and it feels weird to have a class that is a verb. However, Beck
emphasized that the organization and clarity are worth the strange nature
of these objects.</p></li><li><p>The idea that <strong>the behavior of programs is more important to get right than
its state or representation</strong>.</p><p>This is best explained with a quote from the book:</p><blockquote><p>Objects model the world through behavior and state. Behavior is the
dynamic, active, computational part of the model. State is what is left
after behavior is done, how the model is represented before, after and
during a computation.</p><p>Of the two, behavior is the more important to get right. The primacy of
behavior is one of the odd truths of objects; odd because it flies in the
face of so much accumulated experience. Back in the bad old days, you
wanted to get the representation right as quickly as possible because
every change to the representation bred changes in many different
computations.</p><p>Objects (done right) change all that. No longer is your system a slave of
its representation. Because objects can hide their representation behind
a wall of messages, you are free to change representation and only affect
one object.</p></blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve anecdotally found this to be true in my own writing, but I only have a
fairly half-baked reason why this should be true in general. For one, state
is the <em>permanent</em> part of your program and so is much harder to change: it
persists between script executions, program invocations, and function
calls. Secondly, it is incredibly easy to code in implicit assumptions
about state into other parts of the program: when the state representation
changes, all these assumptions must then be weeded out of your code and
modified appropriately.</p><p>The meatiest example I can give is the one below, so let&rsquo;s move along!</p></li><li><p>The pattern of <strong>refining protocols between two programs</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>How do you code the interaction between two objects that need to remain
independent?</p><p>Refine the protocol between the objects so the words used are consistent.</p></blockquote><p>I actually talked about this best practice pattern in my <a href=https://buttondown.email/eigenfoo/archive/tfp-joint-dists/>last
newsletter</a>,
where I discussed the design of TFP. The somewhat more concrete problem is
this: if program A constructs some object that program B consumes, then it
is crucially important to get the representation of that object kosher. Any
changes to that object will require significant (and probably painful!)
changes to both programs A and B.</p><p>The best practice pattern here is to refine the protocol between the two
programs and specify a contract for these intermediate objects: all objects
must have such and such properties, so that programs A and B can do whatever
they want, so long as they fulfill the contract. This was exactly the
situation with specifying and constructing joint distributions before
passing them off to inference algorithms: by refining and specifying a
contract for <code>tfp.JointDistribution</code>s, the TFP team was able to maintain the
independence of the model specification programs and the inference
algorithms.</p></li></ol></content><p><a href=https://www.georgeho.org/blog/typography/>#typography</a></p></main><footer><form action=https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/eigenfoo method=post target=popupwindow onsubmit='window.open("https://buttondown.email/eigenfoo","popupwindow")' class=embeddable-buttondown-form><label for=bd-email>Get my (monthly?) blog posts over email:</label><br><input type=email name=email id=bd-email placeholder=your@email.com>
