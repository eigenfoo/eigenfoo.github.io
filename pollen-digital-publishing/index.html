digital publishing. The catalyst was the book <a href=https://practicaltypography.com/><em>Practical Typography</em> by
Matthew Butterick</a>. There were so many
interesting things about it: it is gorgeous, it expounds well-argued (if
slightly controversial) views on how the average writer should think about
typography, it has a little widget that would change the book&rsquo;s typeface to
showcase Buttericks&rsquo; fonts for sale, it is published online but &mdash; and
Butterick makes a big point of this &mdash; is not free.</p><p>Most interesting to me, however, was how the book was written and published
with a tool written specifically for the book &mdash;
<a href=https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/>Pollen</a>. A good explanatory analogy (at
least for those in the data science and engineering world) is that it’s like R
Markdown (in that it’s a markup language that allows arbitrary R code to be
embedded in it), but instead of R, it’s Racket, and instead of Markdown, it’s
your own domain-specific markup language that you build with Racket.</p><p>After playing around with Pollen for a bit, I think I&rsquo;m sold. Two big reasons:</p><ol><li>Write your own markup<ul><li>You can write your own &ldquo;HTML tags&rdquo; &mdash; so for example, if you&rsquo;re writing a
technical document and want to emphasize certain jargon upon first
mention, you can write a <code>firstmention</code> tag, and have it italicize the
tagged text and append it to a glossary with a link to its first mention
in your document. The cool thing is that tags are just functions in
Racket, which allow you to transform the input text arbitrarily.</li><li>As you can imagine, the ability to write your own markup really lets you
tailor it to the content at hand.</li></ul></li><li>Multi-format publishing<ul><li>This lets you write in one input format, and output to multiple formats -
so once I make changes to the source files, I can immediately have an
HTML, LaTeX, PDF, and plain text format of my writing.</li></ul></li></ol><p><em>But what about Markdown or LaTeX or ReStructured Text or &mdash;</em> none of them
give you flexibility or extensibility that Pollen does. In the case of Markdown
or ReStructured Text, you just get a subset of HTML features in a way that
looks more palatable to the average developer. If this suffices for your
publishing needs, that&rsquo;s great - but if it doesn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re left in a tough
place. LaTeX - as Butterick readily admits - did a lot of things right, but at
the end of the day it&rsquo;s just another format that Pollen can target. (I think
Pollen was named in the spirit of LaTeX by the way - in the sense that people
are commonly allergic to both of them.)</p><p>Now here&rsquo;s the &ldquo;downside&rdquo; - Pollen is written in
<a href=https://racket-lang.org>Racket</a> (which is a dialect of Lisp), and any
non-trivial applications will probably involve you learning a bit of Racket.
I&rsquo;d say that that&rsquo;s a good thing, if nothing else than for some self-education.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a very simple example to convince you (if you want a longer form answer,
I&rsquo;d recommend Butterick&rsquo;s <a href=https://beautifulracket.com/appendix/why-racket-why-lisp.html><em>Why Racket? Why
Lisp?</em></a>)</p><p>Most languages represent HTML as a string (which conceals the semantics of HTML
tags), or as a tree (which conceals the sequential nature of the HTML). Neither
option is great. Lisps, however, could represent a snippet of HTML as follows:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010>&#39;</span><span style=color:#f92672>(</span>span <span style=color:#f92672>((</span>class <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;author&#34;</span><span style=color:#f92672>)(</span>id <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;primary&#34;</span><span style=color:#f92672>)(</span>living <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;true&#34;</span><span style=color:#f92672>))</span> <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Prof. Leonard&#34;</span><span style=color:#f92672>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Keeping in mind that <code>(f x y)</code> is Lisp&rsquo;s way of saying <code>f(x, y)</code> and we see
that Lisps cleanly model HTML as <em>nested function application</em>, which really
blows open the door to opportunities in marking up your text.</p><p>At any rate, that&rsquo;s probably enough said about Pollen. Let me show you what I
managed to put together with it in one or two spare weekends &mdash;
<a href=https://cooper.georgeho.org/><code>cooper.georgeho.org</code></a>. I was hunting around for
dummy text that I could use to play around with &mdash; Lorem Ipsum seemed trite,
and the U.S. Constitution seemed overdone, so I reached for some historical
documents of my alma mater. Hope you like it!</p></content><p><a href=https://www.georgeho.org/blog/typography/>#Typography</a></p></main><footer><form action=https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/eigenfoo method=post target=popupwindow onsubmit='window.open("https://buttondown.email/eigenfoo","popupwindow")' class=embeddable-buttondown-form><label for=bd-email>Get my (monthly?) blog posts over email:</label><br><input type=email name=email id=bd-email placeholder=your@email.com>
