## Ingredients

- 1 pound macaroni
- Kosher salt
- 1 pound mushrooms, roughly sliced
- 2 large onions, finely sliced
- 1 pound sliced cooked ham, cut into ½-inch cubes
- 10 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 4 cups evaporated milk
- Black pepper
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, or more to taste
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
- ½ pound sharp cheddar, grated
- ½ pound gouda, grated
- ¼ pound American cheese, thinly sliced
- ¼ pound mozzarella, cubed
- 3 scallions, biased

### Substitutions

- Any pasta will suffice, but I like pastas with high surface area (it's just a
  vehicle for the cheese sauce, after all) like cavatappi, gemelli or (my
  favorite) [cascatelli](https://www.sfoglini.com/collections/cascatelli).
  Elbow macaroni is the classic and nostalgic choice.
- Evaporated milk can be substituted with half-and-half (less protein but more
  fat, which will result in a creamier sauce) or whole milk (less protein and
  fat than evaporated milk, which will result in a thinner sauce).
- Pre-shredded cheese is not an acceptable substitute for freshly grated
  cheese: they are covered in anti-clumping agents like potato starch which
  will prevent it from melting smoothly and evenly, ironically giving you
  clumps.
- Feel free to mix up the cheeses; see Cooking Notes below. The *quantity* of
  cheese is non-optional: you want 1.5 pounds of cheese per pound of macaroni.

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Add the macaroni to an empty pot and add
   enough cold water to cover the macaroni by 1 inch. Add salt until the water
   tastes like seawater. Cook until macaroni is just shy of al dente, about 2
   minutes less than package directions. Drain the pasta, run under cold water
   to stop the cooking, and set aside.
2. In a skillet, melt two tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the
   mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until they have given up their
   liquid and are brown, about 15 minutes. Add the onion and continue cooking,
   stirring, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the ham and
   continue cooking, stirring, for another minute. Set aside.
3. In a medium saucepan, melt 8 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the
   flour, whisking until smooth. Lower the heat. Add the evaporated milk in
   ½-cup portions, whisking until smooth before adding the next portion. Add
   the salt, pepper, mustard, cayenne and cheeses and whisk until smooth.
4. Transfer the macaroni, mushroom/onion/ham mixture and cheese sauce to a
   casserole dish, add the cubes of mozzarella and mix well. Top with
   breadcrumbs, if using. Bake for 20 minutes. Let sit for 10 minutes before
   serving with scallions.

- **Yield:** 8–10 servings.
- **Time:** 1 hour preparation; 1½ hours cooking.

## Cooking Notes

- By the end of step three, the cheese sauce is just about the same consistency
  as you can expect to serve (it will thicken as you bake and as it cools). Add
  more milk to make thinner, or more cheese or flour to make thicker.
- If the cheese sauce is thin, lumpy or appears broken, it means that the flour
  is not evenly dispersed throughout the sauce: smooth it out with an immersion
  blender. This is why we add the milk in portions: it is easier to disperse
  the flour in a small amount of liquid.
- The cheese sauce is a mixture of water, protein and fat (and
  emulsifiers/stabilizers). Loosely speaking:
    - More *water* (mostly via the milk) will make the sauce *thinner.*
    - More *protein* (mostly via the cheese) will make the sauce *more gooey.*
    - More *fat* (via both the milk and cheese) will make the sauce *creamier.*
    - *Emulsifiers* (via the American cheese) and *stabilizers* (the flour)
      *prevent splitting* and allow the sauce to *melt evenly*. ([They work
      differently from a chemical
      perspective,](https://www.cookingscienceguy.com/pages/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Emulsions-and-Emulsifiers1.pdf)
      but their effect is the same.)
- You can read this recipe in terms of striking this balance.
    - **Using evaporated milk or half-and-half instead of whole milk:** this
      lowers the water content of your sauce.
    - **Using low-moisture, hard cheeses:** they have more protein molecules
      which are more tightly bound together, and are therefore more gooey when
      melted. Cheddar, gruyère and gouda are good choices.
    - **Using American cheese:** American cheese contains emulsifiers and is
      designed to melt into a smooth, gooey liquid.
- While hard cheeses are stretchy because of their strongly interlocking
  proteins, stretch-curd cheeses are in a league of their own because they're
  plasticized/kneaded and have a fibrous structure. Mozzarella, provolone and
  halloumi are good choices. I'm not sure if mixing the cubes in at the end is
  the right move: it may be better to melt it in the sauce, so that the
  stretchiness.
- [Making your own
  breadcrumbs](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-breadcrumbs-7482253) is
  a great way to add more texture and seasoning. This can be done ahead of time
  and stored in an airtight container.
