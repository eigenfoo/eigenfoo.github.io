## Ingredients

**For the panna cotta:**

- Neutral oil or nonstick cooking spray, for the ramekins
- 1 cup and 3 tablespoons whole milk
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 4 teaspoons (~1.5 pouches) powdered unflavored gelatin
- ½ cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅛ teaspoon kosher salt
- 30 grams Thai tea (~2 pouches)

**For the mango coulis:**

- 1 mango, roughly chopped
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1 small lime

## Directions

**For the panna cotta:**

1. In a small saucepan, mix 1 cup whole milk, heavy cream, sugar, vanilla
   extract and kosher salt over low heat. Add the Thai tea to a tea filter bag
   and steep at ~50°C for 30 minutes, or more to taste. Remove from or return
   to heat as needed.
1. Meanwhile, pour the remaining 3 tablespoons whole milk into a small bowl.
   Sprinkle the gelatin onto the milk in an even layer and set aside for 10
   minutes for the gelatin to "bloom". The surface of the milk will turn dry
   and wrinkly.
1. Remove the tea bag. If tea has leaked into the cream mixture, strain the
   cream mixture through a nut milk bag to remove any tea leaves.
1. Add the bloomed gelatin to the cream mixture, and stir until the gelatin is
   completely dissolved, returning to heat if needed.
1. Transfer the mixture to a large glass measuring cup or other heat-proof
   container with a pouring spout. Divide the mixture among ramekins. Cover and
   refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.

**For the mango coulis:**

1. Add mango, sugar and lime juice to a small saucepan and cook until mango is
   very soft and falls apart, about 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat and let
   cool.
2. Blend mixture until very smooth (an immersion blender is great for this).
   Adjust sugar and lime juice to taste.
3. Strain the mixture through a fine-meshed strainer. Refrigerate until thick,
   at least 4 hours.

- **Yield:** ~6 servings
- **Time:** 30 minutes preparation; 30 minutes cooking; overnight refrigeration.

## Cooking Notes

- Under no circumstances let the cream mixture steam: boiling off water will
  concentrate fats and proteins, which will lead to a grainy or curdled texture
  or separation of ingredients (like fats and liquids).
- Transferring the cream mixture from a saucepan to a pouring container is
  irksome and adds to the dishes, but it makes dividing the mixture *much*
  simpler and cleaner.
- If you plan to unmold the panna cotta before serving, make sure to lightly
  brush the ramekins with neutral oil, wiping away any excess with a paper
  towel.
