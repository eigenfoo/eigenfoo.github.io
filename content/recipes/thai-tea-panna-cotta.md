- Adapted from [this internet
  recipe](https://www.cooking-therapy.com/oolong-panna-cotta/) and [this New
  York Times Cooking
  recipe.](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1024352-panna-cotta)

## Ingredients

- Neutral oil or nonstick cooking spray, for the ramekins
- 1 cup and 3 tablespoons whole milk
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 2½ teaspoons (1 pouch) powdered unflavored gelatin
- ½ cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅛ teaspoon kosher salt
- 30 grams Thai tea (~2 pouches)

## Directions

1. Lightly brush six ramekins, water glasses or molds with neutral oil, wiping
   away any excess with a paper towel.
1. In a small saucepan, mix 1 cup whole milk, heavy cream, sugar, vanilla
   extract and kosher salt over low heat. Add the Thai tea and steep at ~50°C
   for 30 minutes, or more to taste. Remove from or return to heat as needed.
1. Meanwhile, pour the remaining 3 tablespoons whole milk into a small bowl.
   Sprinkle the gelatin onto the milk in an even layer and set aside for 10
   minutes for the gelatin to "bloom". The surface of the milk will turn dry
   and wrinkly.
1. Strain the cream mixture through a nut milk bag, ideally into another
   saucepan (or possibly the same one, if you can wash it before straining).
1. Add the bloomed gelatin to the cream mixture, and stir until the gelatin is
   completely dissolved, returning to heat if needed.
1. Transfer the mixture to a large glass measuring cup or other heat-proof
   container with a pouring spout. Divide the mixture among the prepared
   ramekins. Cover and refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours, preferably
   overnight.

- **Yield:** ~6 servings
- **Time:** 30 minutes preparation; 30 minutes cooking; overnight refrigeration.

## Cooking Notes

- Under no circumstances let the cream mixture boil: this will lead to a grainy
  or curdled texture or separation of ingredients (like fats and liquids).
- It's possible that straining through a nut milk bag is unnecessary, and that
  a fine mesh strainer will suffice (or perhaps no straining is needed at all).
- Obviously tnsferring the cream mixture back and forth between saucepan and a
  pouring container is irksome, but it makes dividing the mixture *much*
  simpler and cleaner.
