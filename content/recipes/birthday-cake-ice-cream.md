- Adapted from [this quick, no-churn
  recipe.](https://bsugarmama.com/cake-batter-and-buttercream-ice-cream/)
- In my opinion this ice cream is *unbearably* sweet, but it's been a hit at
  dinner parties!

## Ingredients

**For the buttercream chips:**

- 8 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 3 cups powdered sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon or more milk, as needed

**For the ice cream:**

- 14 ounces (1 can) sweetened condensed milk
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup yellow cake mix
- ½ teaspoon salt
- Rainbow sprinkles

### Substitutions

- Sweetened condensed milk will give the ice cream a thick, gooey texture. For
  a more traditional custard-solid texture, I suspect that substituting with 1
  cup whole milk, ⅔ cup sugar and 6 egg yolks would do the job. If using, look
  at the cooking instructions in [The New York Times master ice cream
  recipe.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/01/dining/the-master-ice-cream-recipe.html)

## Directions

**For the buttercream chips:**

1. Beat the butter until soft and creamy.
2. Add the powdered sugar and salt. You shouldn't need to add any milk because
   the buttercream should be creamy; if not, add one teaspoon of milk at a time
   until creamy.
3. Line a baking sheet with waxed paper or parchment paper. With a spoon,
   spread the buttercream evenly on the baking sheet (it's fine if it's not
   perfectly even: it'll give the chips some texture) and freeze until
   solidified, about 20 minutes.
4. Once the buttercream is frozen, break into medium-sized chips. Place the
   chips in a bowl and return to the freezer until ready to serve.

**For the ice cream:**

1. In a small pot, simmer sweetened condensed milk, heavy cream, vanilla
   extract and salt until mixture is homogeneous, thick enough to coat the back
   of a spoon, and no longer tastes of flour (about 175 degrees). Remove pot
   from heat.
2. Cool mixture to room temperature. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or
   overnight.
3. Churn in an ice cream machine according to manufacturer’s instructions.
   Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until
   needed. Serve with buttercream chips and rainbow sprinkles.

- **Yield:** ~1 quart
- **Time:** 2 hours preparation; overnight refrigeration.
