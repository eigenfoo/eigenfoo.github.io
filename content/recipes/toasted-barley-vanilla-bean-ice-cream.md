- Adapted from [Elanne Boake's
  recipe.](https://www.elanneboake.com/recipe-blog/boricha-and-vanilla-bean-ice-cream)

## Ingredients

- 350g milk
- 350g cream
- 20g skim milk powder
- 80g sugar (sucrose)
- 40g light corn syrup
- 2 egg yolks
- 10g vanilla bean paste
- 40g toasted barley
- 1g xanthan gum
- Salt

(To make toasted barley, simply heat pearled barley in a dry pan until golden
to dark brown, perhaps even blackened in spots.)

## Directions

1. Mix all ingredients together except for the egg yolks and salt. Bring to a
   simmer, 50–70°C, and steep for 15–20 minutes, stirring frequently. Temper
   the egg yolks into the mixture.
2. If time allows, cover with a kitchen towel and allow to steep further and
   cool to room temperature. If so inclined, add water to recover any water
   that boiled off while simmering.
3. Strain into a container to remove the barley and any coagulated clumps of
   yolk, season with a pinch of salt and refrigerate overnight.
4. Churn with an ice cream machine according to manufacturer’s instructions.
   Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until
   needed.

- **Yield:** ~2 quarts
- **Time:** 1 hour preparation; overnight refrigeration.
