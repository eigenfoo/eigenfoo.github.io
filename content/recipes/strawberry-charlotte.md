## Ingredients

- 1 cup sugar
- ¾ pounds strawberries, quartered
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- Any sour liqueur, to taste
- 1½ envelopes powdered gelatin
- ¼ cup cold water
- ½ cup boiling water
- 2 cups purée strawberries
- 3 large egg whites, beaten to stiff peaks
- 1 cup heavy cream, whipped to soft peaks
- A handful of whole strawberries with stems attached, for garnish

## Directions

**For the sauce:**

1. In a saucepan over medium heat, add the ¼ cup sugar, quartered strawberries,
   and 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Simmer until the mixture is a thick sauce,
   about 20 minutes. Crush the strawberries with a wooden spoon, if desired.
   Let cool and add sour liqueur to taste. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

**For the charlotte:**

1. Soften the gelatin in the cold water in a bowl, about 5 minutes. Add the
   boiling water and stir until the gelatin is dissolved. Add ¾ cups sugar, 1
   tablespoon lemon juice and 2 cups puréed strawberries. Mix, let cool, then
   chill until starting to set, around 1 hour.
2. Whip the gelatin mixture until somewhat fluffy. Fold in the egg whites and
   then the cream. Add sour liqueur to taste. Pour into serving containers and
   refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.
3. Decorate with a few whole berries. Serve with the sweetened crushed
   strawberries as a sauce.

- **Yield:** 8 servings.
- **Time:** 1½ hour preparation; 1 hour cooking; 1 hour refrigeration.
