After [my last puzzle with The Rackenfracker](/crosswords/010/), I'm sure
you're eager for a change of pace, so here's a bite-sized puzzle! Thanks to
Michael Colella and [`dianyx`](https://crosshare.org/dianyXwords) for the test
solves.

Please do check out the clue workshop below, and I'll be back soon with another
full-sized crossword.

## Clue Workshop

Today's clue workshop comes from [my previous quiptic](/crosswords/009), so if
you haven't given that a go yet, just keep on scrolling!

- **Answer:** SIGNIFICANT
- **Definition:** Important
- **Wordplay:** SIGN ("to accept package") IF I CAN'T ("if I happen to be
  unable to")

This is an example of a pun or
[heteronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronym_(linguistics)), which
concretely just means that a word becomes a different word or phrase upon some
respacing or wilful misinterpretation.

These are some of my favorite clues, because the wordplay is so obvious once
you see it, yet changes the way you see the word forever. Also, it tends to be
the kind of clue that hooks beginners the easiest --- a very underrated
benefit, in my view!

Whether it's thinking of a TOWER as a tugboat (a tow-er, a thing that tows), or
imagining a UFO sitting atop a pagoda whenever I see DISCONTENT (DISC ON TENT),
or the quiet thrill I get after being reminded of [Robert
Landsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Landsburg) every time I see
MOUNT ST HELENS (MOUNTS THE LENS)... Here's to more homonyms!
