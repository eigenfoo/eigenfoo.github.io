I'm excited to have a cryptic in the inaugural [lemonade
disco](https://www.taylormadecrosswords.com/)! It's called "Last Round" and,
aptly, is the last puzzle in the suite. It was also my first (hopefully not
last!) chance to work with the incredible Steve Mossberg, who's been a tireless
and gracious editor.

For those who don't know, lemonade disco is a monthly crossword suite by
[Taylor Johnson](https://twitter.com/lemonade_disco_/), dedicated to providing
new constructors and constructors from underrepresented backgrounds a platform
to showcase their work. Check it out --- my puzzle is in the company of some
delightful non-cryptic crosswords as well, and it's also the only way to solve
my latest puzzle.

Without further ado, I hope you enjoy!
