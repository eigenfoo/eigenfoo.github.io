Hello! Long time no crossword!

2023 has been a whirlwind so far, and I haven't had as much time to devote to
puzzles as I would've liked --- we're ⅓ of the way through and I'm just putting
out my first cryptic!

Earlier this year, I had the chance to attend [Boatman's Crossword
Masterclass](https://boatmancryptics.co.uk/crossword-masterclasses/), and this
is the puzzle that I've been working on ever since. The theme here is ~~stolen
from~~ inspired by [one of Boatman's puzzles from
2011](https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/25404), which I solved for
the class.

Two more remarks before you dive in:

1. I'm pleased with how this puzzle handles its theme in two ways, which I hope
   adds to the solving experience, and
2. There aren't special instructions, but there _is_ a teaser --- please read
   it here, in Crosshare or in the PDF before solving!

As always, a huge thank you to to [Steve
Mossberg](https://www.patreon.com/squarechase) for the test solve.

Without further ado, I hope you enjoy!

## Clue Workshop

I'll keep the clue workshop short this time --- just a few sentences on a clue
from [my previous puzzle](/crosswords/018/).

<p style="text-align:center">
What you might use to pay a tarot interpreter (4,6)

- **Answer:** CARD READER
- **Annotation:** Double definition (what you might use to pay / a tarot
  interpreter)

Not long after I published the cryptic, a fellow constructor dropped a note
saying that they were disappointed not to see CAR DREADER --- which would've
been a delightful heteronym! Sometimes you see better cluing angles only after
you've sent your puzzle out into the world...

</details>

> **Teaser:**
>
> Your taxi clatters across the gravel road, rattling and ringing across the
> silence of the night before pulling up to the oaken front doors of the Tudor
> mansion. You've hardly stepped out of the vehicle before the sergeant
> approaches you with a grave expression.
>
> "Detective, I'm afraid you've arrived just in time for a real mess," the
> sergeant says, their voice low and serious.
>
> You furrow your brow. "What are we looking at?"
>
> "We're still finding that out for ourselves, but it doesn't look pretty. It's
> going to be a long night."
>
> You nod, your eyes scanning the details of the mansion's imperturbable face.
> "Alright. Let's see what we're dealing with here."
