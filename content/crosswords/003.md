As promised, I made a cryptic mini this week! I think I've figured out some
rules of thumb for making more accessible cryptics --- in descending order of
impact:

1. Straightforward definitions (so no "question mark definitions")
2. Non-compound wordplay (so only one wordplay per clue)
3. Smaller grids (so less work for both solver and setter!)

I'm hoping to challenge myself and construct a 15× puzzle next, so it might
take longer than usual --- perhaps two weeks?

Thanks to Michael Colella for the test solve, and hope you enjoy!
