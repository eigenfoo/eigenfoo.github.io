Hello, long time no puzzle!

It's [lemonade disco's](https://www.taylormadecrosswords.com/) first birthday,
and I'm pleased to have a cryptic in it. It's called "Hot Spots", and is a
larger and more fully-themed puzzle than [the puzzle I made for the inaugural
lemonade disco.](/crosswords/014/)

For those who don't know, lemonade disco is a bimonthly (i.e. every other
month) crossword suite, dedicated providing a platform for crossword
constructors to showcase their talent and creativity in an inclusive,
supportive space. Check it out --- my cryptic is in the company of some other
delightful puzzles!

Without further ado, I hope you enjoy!

> It’s a wild night out — you and your friends are going to 15a! Everybody’s
> trying to get to one of the four highlighted entries because their clues just
> aren’t like the others… but you know that this puzzle is about having a good
> time no matter where you are.
