This is the first cryptic crossword I've constructed in a while: I'm trying to
get (back?) into the habit of making stuff regularly.

I'm still figuring out the difficulty of my crosswords: Crosshare tells me I've
written [a double black
diamond](https://crosshare.org/articles/crossword-difficulty-ratings), and an
Internet stranger  has called it _["a mix of easy and diabolical
clues",](https://www.reddit.com/r/crosswords/comments/ubjlhw/comment/i66jtch)_
which I'm inexplicably pleased by!

Anyways, a huge thank you to [Steve Mossberg](https://squarepursuit.com/) for
the test solve, and I hope you enjoy!
