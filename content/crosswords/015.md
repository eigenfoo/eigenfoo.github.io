A 15× themeless for my 15th puzzle!

Before diving in, I wanted to call out that [_Last Round,_ my previous
puzzle](/crosswords/014/) (which featured in [Taylor Johnson's lemonade
disco](https://www.taylormadecrosswords.com/suites/blog-post-title-one-d6lj7)),
is one of the most streamed puzzles I've made, which was immensely gratifying
to see! If you want to check one out, it's been solved by a real who's-who of
cryptic streamers:

As always, a huge thank you to [Kit

solves --- and without further ado, I hope you enjoy!

## Clue Workshop

Today I'll discuss a clue from [_In One
Basket,_](/crosswords/010/) my variety collaboration
with [The Rackenfracker](https://www.therackenfracker.com/). If you haven't
solved that yet, please do give it a go --- I think it's the puzzle that I'm
proudest of so far!

<p style="text-align:center">
In the ’90s, Bush hit Gore initially and sincerely — lacking leadership, in need of reform (9)
</p>

- **Answer:** GLYCERINE
- **Definition:** In the ’90s, Bush hit
- **Wordplay:** G[ore] + ([s]INCERELY)\*

One thing which I didn't like about this clue was that the definition required
you to know the [1994 song by
Bush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOllF3TgAsM).

While I don't mind requiring solvers to know facts about the world, I try to
avoid pop culture and celebrity names: not because they don't deserve to be in
crosswords, but because they're just not what I'm good at solving! I mostly
live under a rock, and clues that ask me to know names of TV shows are about as
helpful to me as having no clue at all.

In this case though, there was something else to consider: the entry has both
variant _spellings_ (GLYCERINE in British English; GLYCERIN in American
English) and a variant _name_ (GLYCEROL). Since we were making an American
variety cryptic, we didn't feel it was fair to clue the British spelling of a
word without some indication. Defining the entry as a "Bush hit" circumvented
this problem: the song is unambiguously called Glycerine.
