A _themed_ puzzle this time! Themes are tricky to execute in cryptics (not to
mention that this is my first themed puzzle), so I'm pleased with how this
turned out. I don't think the theme drives up the difficulty of the puzzle ---
and in fact, may make it somewhat easier...? But anyways, you'll have to solve
the puzzle to find out more!

Huge thanks to [The Rackenfracker](https://www.therackenfracker.com/) for being
the sounding board for this theme, as well as  Andy Lim, [Dave (a.k.a.
`dritters`)](https://ritterskamp.site/xwords/) and Michael Colella for the test
solves --- everyone involved has made measurable improvements to the puzzle. I
hope you enjoy!

> **Instructions:** While constructing this puzzle, five entries proved just
> too hot to handle! These entries have been clued with wordplay only.
