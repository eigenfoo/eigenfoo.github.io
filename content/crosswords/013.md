We're back with a regular-sized themeless puzzle! But before we dive in, I want
to quickly plug [my newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/loplop), which
is the best way to get notified whenever a new Loplop puzzle goes up.

<div id="buttondown-embed" style="border:1px solid #E6E6E6;padding:30px;text-align:center;">
<form
  action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/loplop"
  method="post"
  target="popupwindow"
  onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/loplop', 'popupwindow')"
  class="embeddable-buttondown-form"

  <label for="bd-email">Get my crosswords over email:</label>
  <input type="email" name="email" id="bd-email" />

As always, a huge thank you to Michael Colella and `dadgumituh` and `jsmr25` at
[The Rackenfracker](https://www.therackenfracker.com/) for the test solves ---
I hope you enjoy!

## Clue Workshop

Today's clue workshop discusses a clue from [a previous
quiptic](/crosswords/009), so if you haven't given that a go yet, please come
back later!

<p style="text-align:center">
Tyrant sustaining authoritarian rule, primarily! (4)
</p>

- **Answer:** TSAR
- **Definition:** Tyrant sustaining authoritarian rule, primarily!
- **Wordplay:**  T[yrant] S[ustaining] A[uthoritarian] R[ule]

This is actually a clue I regret, simply because it's too easy! I've learnt to
make the clues for the shortest entries (so three-, four-, maybe even
five-letter entries) as hard as I'm willing to push it in the puzzle, since
otherwise those entries are just gimmes, neither challenging nor entertaining
to solvers.

To put another way: the shorter an entry is, the easier it gets, in the absence
of a countervailing increase in cluing difficulty. With the _shortest_ entries,
you shouldn't hold back from cranking up the difficulty as far as you're
willing to go.
