A lightly challenging but hopefully still accessible 11×11 puzzle today!

I'm very grateful for a reliable pool of test solvers: whether they're cryptic
newcomers who opine on the overall difficulty of a puzzle, or wordplay veterans
who pick on my cryptic grammar, clue by clue. This week, a huge thanks to
Michael Colella, Ziv Stern and Jay White for test solving and clue editing.

I'm not sure when the next Loplop Cryptic will drop, but I can say that I'm
super excited about the puzzle I'm currently working on. I don't know where
this puzzle will ultimately live (perhaps not Crosshare!), so stay tuned, and
[subscribe to my newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/loplop) if you'd like to be
notified when it goes up!
