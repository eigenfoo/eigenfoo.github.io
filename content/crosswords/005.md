A lightly challenging but hopefully still accessible 11×11 puzzle today!

I'm very grateful for a reliable pool of test solvers: whether they're cryptic
newcomers who opine on the overall difficulty of a puzzle, or wordplay veterans
who pick on my cryptic grammar, clue by clue. This week, a huge thanks to
Michael Colella, Ziv Stern and Jay White for test solving and clue editing.

I'm currently working on an exciting _variety_ of puzzle, but I'm not sure when
it'll be done, or even where it'll live when it's finished. If you want to get
notified when it's up, make sure you follow me somehow! (My
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/__loplop) and
[newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/loplop) are your best bets.)
