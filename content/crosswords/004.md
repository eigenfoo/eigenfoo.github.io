Wow, constructing a 15×15 crossword is tough stuff! Coming up with the filled
grid and preliminary clues was only around half the work: the rest was editing
and polishing clues. I'll probably take it easy next week and write a smaller
9×9 or 11×11 puzzle.

Following Steve Mossberg's example, I've published a version of the puzzle
"with wordplay", where each clue tells you the kind of wordplay involved. If
Crosshare supported underlining clues, I would also publish a version of the
puzzle with wordplay and the definition underlined --- but alas!

Huge thanks to [Steve Mossberg](https://squarepursuit.com/) and [Kit
Sovereign](https://twitter.com/kitsovereign) for test solves and suggestions
for clue improvements!
