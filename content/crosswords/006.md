A full-sized cryptic to round off the long weekend here in the US! As it turns
out, creating variety cryptics is _much harder_ than I anticipated, and how
better to keep myself motivated than by constructing a regular cryptic? In any
case, progress there is slow but steady, so stay tuned!

In case you missed it, [Dob and Momes over at
Crossweird](https://www.crossweirdpuzzles.com/) recently streamed [my previous
15× cryptic](/crosswords/004/), and it was super gratifying to watch one of my
puzzles being solved and enjoyed. If you weren't able to join for the stream,
you can check it out [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1311524606)!

Thanks to Michael Colella, Ziv Stern and [Steve
Mossberg](https://squarepursuit.com/) for test solves --- hope you enjoy the
puzzle!
