This puzzle is a collaboration with the one and only Crossword Scholar, [Aaron
Riccio](https://crosswordscholar.wordpress.com/)! Every week, Aaron writes a
[Cryptic Roundup](https://crosswordscholar.wordpress.com/category/cryptic/)
which provides a thorough analysis of cryptic clues which catch his fancy.
It's always a delight to browse through the smoothest, funniest and
fiendish...est clues from the cryptic world from the past week. If you're
enjoying cryptics, you'll definitely want to check out [The Crossword Scholar
blog](https://crosswordscholar.wordpress.com/category/cryptic/), or [sign up
for his newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/illogicaljoker).

You might call this puzzle _lightly themed,_ if such a thing exists, but of
course you'll have to solve for the full scoop! A huge thank you to Michael
Colella and [Chris Evans (a.k.a. Mental
Playground)](https://mpcryptics.blogspot.com/) for the test solves.

Without further ado --- I hope you enjoy!
