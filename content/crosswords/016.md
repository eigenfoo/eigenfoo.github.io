Surprise! Not a cryptic this time!

Puns and anagrams (a.k.a. P&As or _pandas_ 🐼) are wily puzzles. [Michael
Lieberman](https://twitter.com/Footnote24) points out that puns should be _at
least_ as silly or wacky as the question-mark clues in regular American-style
crosswords. As someone who loves foxy wordplay, I'm excited by the opportunity
to turn the clues up to two or even three question marks.

For those unfamiliar, [Will Shortz wrote a Wordplay
column](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/crosswords/variety-puns-and-anagrams.html)
reintroducing them back in 2017, and [Andrew Ries has also written about
pandas](https://www.ariespuzzles.com/2019/02/puns-anagrams-1.html) on his blog
--- I won't be able to put it much better than the two of them.

I want to push back on the perception that pandas are simply watered-down
cryptics. Hopefully, after seeing the four marquee clues in this puzzle, you'll
agree that they're best served by being in a panda instead of a cryptic --- and
in fact in some cases they simply _couldn't_ be in a cryptic!

I had more help than usual in making this puzzle, since this is my first fully
interlocking grid: a huge thank you to [Norah
Sharpe](https://www.norahsharpe.com/) and [Steve
Mossberg](https://squarepursuit.com/) for their watchful eyes on my baby steps
in American-style gridding, and [Kate Chin
Park](https://kateschmatecrosswords.weebly.com/) for the test solve. This is a
11× grid as I find my sea legs, but I'm hoping to work my way up to full-sized
15× puzzles.

Without further ado, I hope you enjoy!

## Clue Workshop

This time I'll discuss a clue from [my previous cryptic](/crosswords/015/). If
you haven't solved that yet, please do give it a go!

<p style="text-align:center">
Offended, worried, losing head... needing to slide in hot tub (10)
</p>

- **Answer:** TRESPASSED
- **Definition:** Offended
- **Wordplay:** [s]TRESSED containing SPA

According to Crosshare, this was the last clue for most solvers to get, and I
was disheartened to see so many solvers floundering with it! In hindsight, I
might have kept a closer eye on the spike in difficulty from this clue.

To enumerate, this clue has:

1. A definition that isn't the obvious sense of the answer (the generic "to sin
   or offend" instead of the more common "to encroach or intrude"),
2. Two substitutions (STRESSED for "worried"; SPA for "hot tub"),
3. Two wordplay mechanics: a beheadment and an insertion (SPA into [s]TRESSED),
4. One of the longest answers and a central placement in the grid (thereby
   denying solvers a lot of helpful crossers if they don't get this clue).

Ordinarily I wouldn't blink at any of these things, but altogether it adds up
to a blemish on the puzzle: I noticed it, and I'm sure some solvers did too.  A
simple fix would be to simply give either STRESSED or SPA away _en clair_ (i.e.
directly in the clue). I would probably have opted for:

<p style="text-align:center">
Offended, <b>stressed,</b> losing head... needing to slide in hot tub (10)
