Happy December! 2022 is quickly coming to a close, and I'm frantically working
through my cryptic backlog to make room for the puzzle suites that are about to
drop! It's crazy to think that this blog is barely a year old --- I'm really
pleased with the progress I've made in the past eight months, both as a solver
and a constructor.  

Anyways, I recently had some cryptic clues rejected from an outlet (mostly
because of some oversights on my part, which is good news I think!). This is my
"consolation puzzle" --- which may explain some clunky clues in there, as well
as two surfaces ;)

As always, a huge thank you to to Michael Colella, [Alex
Boisvert](https://www.alexboisvert.com/sitepuzzles.php) and [Steve
Mossberg](https://www.patreon.com/squarechase) for the test solves.

Without further ado, I hope you enjoy!

## Clue Workshop

This time I'll discuss a clue from [my very first puzzle on this
blog](/crosswords/001) --- if you haven't solved that, uh... maybe give it a
go? It might be rough around the edges, but I like to think there are some gems
in there!

Rationale for a demilitarized China? (11)

- **Answer:** EXPLANATION
- **Definition:** Rationale
- **Wordplay:** EX-P.L.A. NATION (a demilitarized China?)

This was definitely one of the brightest clues I wrote in my first few puzzles.

Even though the clue required some pretty specific knowledge (that the name of
China's military is the People's Liberation Army, a.k.a. the PLA), I adored the
fun and funny heteronym, which [I've written about
previously](/crosswords/011/).
