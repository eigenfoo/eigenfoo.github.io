A quiptic this time! I've been travelling recently, so this puzzle is smaller
than usual, but I hope it'll still entertain cryptic newcomers, and serve as a
fun warm-up for cryptic veterans. For those unfamiliar, a quiptic simply means
(a) a smaller grid, but more importantly, (b) _only one wordplay mechanic per
clue._

In other news in Loplop's crossworld:

1. Both [`joeadultman`](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1313157845) and
   [`danandbabka`](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1315384079) have streamed [my
   previous 15× puzzle](/crosswords/006). They're both excellent crossword
   streamers --- tune in the next time they stream!
2. A kind stranger of the Internet has [digitized and
   uploaded](https://xotaotc.nfshost.com/) _Ximenes on the Art of the
   Crossword_, a seminal book on cryptic crosswords, by one of the progenitors
   of the form itself.

Huge thanks to [Steve Mossberg](https://squarepursuit.com/) for making sure
that I'm constructing quiptics correctly --- I hope you enjoy the puzzle!
