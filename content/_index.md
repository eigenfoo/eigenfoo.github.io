# Hello! I’m George (a.k.a. eigenfoo)

I'm a data scientist at [Flatiron Health](https://flatiron.com/), where I use
machine learning on real-world patient data to accelerate cancer research. I
like natural language processing, Bayesian modelling, open source software,
donuts and coffee.

I'm originally from Hong Kong, now based in New York. Previously, I worked for
[Point72 Asset Management](https://www.point72.com) and
[Quantopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantopian), and I studied engineering at [The
Cooper Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome).
