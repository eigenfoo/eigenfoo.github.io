# Hello! I’m George

...but on the internet, I also go by `eigenfoo` (for data, software and other
technical stuff) and `loplop` (for crosswords and other games).

I work at [Flatiron Health](https://flatiron.com/), where I use machine
learning on real-world patient data to accelerate cancer research. I like
natural language processing, Bayesian modelling, crosswords and food. (I
construct cryptic crosswords [here](/crosswords/), and write down my recipes
[here](/recipes/)).

I'm originally from Hong Kong but now based in New York. Previously, I worked for
[Point72 Asset Management](https://www.point72.com) and
[Quantopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantopian), and I studied
engineering at [The Cooper Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome).
