## Software

- [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3) and
  [PyMC4](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc4)
  - PyMC3 is a popular Python framework for Bayesian modeling and probabilistic
    machine learning, focusing on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and
    variational inference (VI) algorithms.
  - I'm a member of the core development team, and contribute to the PyMC3
    internals and documentation. I wrote [a blog post on tips and tricks for
    Bayesian modelling using
    PyMC3](https://www.georgeho.org/bayesian-modelling-cookbook/).
- [Pyfolio](https://github.com/quantopian/pyfolio) and
  [Alphalens](https://github.com/quantopian/alphalens)
  - Pyfolio and Alphalens are Python libraries for risk analysis and
    performance attribution of financial portfolios, and alpha factor research
    for algorithmic trading. Both libraries are fully integrated into the
    [Quantopian platform](http://quantopian.com/).
  - I developed the risk and performance attribution capabilities of Pyfolio
    (read more on [my blog post here](https://www.georgeho.org/pyfolio/)), and
    help maintain the library. I help develop new features, triage bug reports
    and troubleshoot issues for Alphalens.
- [Knead](https://github.com/font-bakers/knead) and [Glaze](https://github.com/font-bakers/glaze)
  - Knead and Glaze are command line tools and Python libraries for
    preprocessing, manipulating, rendering and visualizing font files and
    algorithmically-generated typefaces.
    Both libraries were written as internal tools for [The Font
    Bakers](https://font-bakers.github.io/), to support their research and
    development workflow. I developed and maintain both projects.

## Datasets

- [`cryptics.georgeho.org`](https://cryptics.georgeho.org/)
  - `cryptics.georgeho.org` is a dataset of [cryptic
    crossword](https://www.newyorker.com/puzzles-and-games-dept/cryptic-crossword/reintroducing-the-new-yorkers-cryptic-crossword)
    clues, indicators and charades, collected from various blogs and publicly
    available digital archives. It is the first and only such data set that is
    openly accessible and larger than any in extant literature, and is a
    significant work of crossword archivism.

## Projects

- [Deep Learning for Algorithmic Type Design](https://font-bakers.github.io/)
  - As a research project pursued in my last year at The Cooper Union, we
    researched a class- and attribute- conditional generative adversarial
    network capable of producing vector graphics, with potential applications
    in algorithmic type design. The generative model was to produce closed
    shapes, with counter spaces, defined by a variable number of quadratic
    BÃ©zier curves. At the time, no generative model with vector graphic output
    has previously appeared in literature.
- [Hate Speech on Reddit](https://www.georgeho.org/reddit-clusters/)
  - As part of a project on [Data Science for Social
    Good](http://ee.cooper.edu/~keene/dssg.html), I ran text clustering
    algorithms on well-known hateful and toxic subreddits, and collaborated
    with a cross-disciplinary team of artists, architects and engineers to
    present the findings at [The Cooper Union 2018 End of Year
    Show](https://cooper.edu/events-and-exhibitions/exhibitions/2018-student-exhibition).
    I also wrote [a blog post on my
    results](https://www.georgeho.org/reddit-clusters/), and [gave a talk on
    the data science that went into the
    project](https://www.georgeho.org/reddit-slides/).
