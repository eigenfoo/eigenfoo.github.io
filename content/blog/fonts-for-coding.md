Sometimes I get sniped by [Hacker News
posts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25159038), and this one plunged me
down a rabbit hole for coding fonts.

Many coding fonts are lightly stressed, monospaced sans serifs: in other words, each glyph takes
the same width, and each glyph looks like a stick figure, with constant stroke
width (a.k.a. [_stress_](https://designshack.net/articles/typography/is-my-type-stressed-a-primer-on-stressed-typography/)) throughout the glyph.

But as [the Internet stranger
`uncanneyvalley`](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25167704) pointed out,
there's decent overlap between "fonts good for coding" and "fonts good for
dyslexia": being able to easily distinguish between visually-similar and
repeated characters.

I think that stressed monospaced serif fonts (i.e. monospaced fonts with serifs that are curved
instead of slab-like, and that are visually thinner than the rest of the glyph)
are generally much better for coding than most default coding typefaces. It turns out
there are very few such fonts: I've had to scour the Internet for them, but you
can have the fruits of my labor for free!
