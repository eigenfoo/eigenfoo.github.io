## What Makes a Good Ice Cream?

Jeni Britton Bauer (of [Jeni's](https://jenis.com/) fame) [thinks there are
four
qualities](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxenGxugerSnIvkm7u28uDK6H5GSpSBEUy)
that make for good ice cream:

1. Flavor
   - Not just what you taste on your tongue, but also what you smell with your
     nose (or even the nasal passage in the back of your mouth!)
1. Texture
   - How creamy or icy, smooth or gritty the ice cream feels between your
     tongue and the roof of your mouth. A good ice cream typically has a
     smooth, creamy texture with no detectable ice crystals or graininess.
1. Body
   - The structure and elasticity of the ice cream: how well the ice cream
     holds its shape and scoops into a ball, and how evenly it melts. A good
     body means that the ice cream is firm, holds its shape well, and melts
     slowly and evenly. An ice cream with poor body might be too hard, too
     soft, or melt too quickly.

1. Finish
   - The aftertaste and "aftermouthfeel" of the ice cream after its been eaten.
     A good finish has a pleasant aftertaste (where the flavors remain
     enjoyable and don't become off-putting or too intense as they linger), and
     leave the palate feeling clean and not oily or greasy.

## The Components of Ice Cream

Broadly speaking, there are eight components in ice cream: fat, sweeteners,
milk solids, flavorings, emulsifiers, stabilizers, water and air.

For a quick overview, take a look at [this guide from
Underbelly.](https://under-belly.org/the-components-of-ice-cream) Here, I give
a brief overview of each component.

### Fat

Fat impacts all four qualities!

- **Flavor:** not only does fat (especially butterfat) taste good on its own,
  but it also absorbs and delivers other flavors. Fat also stretches out the
  intensity of the flavor (e.g. think about the difference between a strawberry
  ice cream and a strawberry sorbet).
- **Texture:** once churned, fat traps air globules, which lends a creamy
  texture to the ice cream.

- **Body**: fat makes the ice cream firmer and slows melting by stabilizing the
  air bubbles
as a solid chunk at cold temperatures, fat is rock hard (just think about frozen butter).
- **Finish:** fat lingers on the palate after the ice cream has been eaten.

Here is [a practical guide to fat in ice
cream](https://www.dreamscoops.com/ice-cream-science/fat-in-ice-cream/) and
[here is more science discussion on their
role.](https://icecreamscience.com/role-fat-ice-cream/)

### Sweeteners

- **Flavor:** sugar is (rather famously) sweet, but not all sugars are equally
  sweet. Ice cream makers estimate the _relative sweetness_ of sugars: that is,
  their sweetness compared to sucrose.
- **Texture:** sugar clings on to water, and the more water that clings onto
  the proteins, the less "free water" there is to pool together and create
  large ice crystals, thereby making the ice cream smoother.
- **Body:** sugar lowers the freezing point of water, keeping some of the water
  fluid below freezing temperatures --- more simply, it keeps the ice cream
  soft and scoopable.

### Proteins (or milk solids non-fat a.k.a. MSNF)

- **Texture:** as proteins (usually, casein and whey from the dairy) denature
  and unfurl they cling on to water --- similar to how sugars do, and with a
  similar effect (smoother ice cream).

### Water

### Air 

- **Texture and Flavor:** the less air in ice cream, the denser it feels in
  your mouth (and therefore, the richer and creamier it tastes).
