I've recently had to learn a lot about natural language processing (NLP), specifically
Transformer-based NLP models.

Similar to my previous blog post on [deep autoregressive
models](https://www.georgeho.org/deep-autoregressive-models/), this blog post is a write-up
of my reading and research: I assume basic familiarity with deep learning, and aim to
highlight general trends in deep NLP, instead of commenting on individual architectures
or systems.

As a disclaimer, this post is by no means exhaustive and is biased towards
Transformer-based models, which seem to be the dominant breed of NLP systems (at least,
at the time of writing).

## Some Architectures and Developments

Here's an (obviously) abbreviated history of Transformer-based models in NLP[^1] in
(roughly) chronological order. I also cover some other non-Transformer-based models,
because I think they illuminate the history of NLP.

1. word2vec and GloVe
   * These were the first instances of word embeddings pre-trained on large amounts of
     unlabeled text. These word embeddings generalized well to most other tasks (even
     with limited amounts of labeled data), and usually led to appreciable improvements
     in performance.
   * These ideas were immensely influential and have served NLP extraordinarily well.
     However, they suffer from a major limitation. They are _shallow_ representations
     that can only be used in the first layer of any network: the remainder of the
     network must still be trained from scratch.
   * The main appeal is well illustrated below: each word has its own vector
     representation, and there are linear vector relationships can encode common-sense
     semantic meanings of words.

        2014.](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)

1. Broadly speaking, after word2vec/GloVe and before Transformers, a lot of ink was
   spilled on other different approaches to NLP, including (but certainly not limited
   to)
   1. Convolutional neural networks
   1. Recurrent neural networks
   1. Reinforcement learning approaches
   1. Memory-augmented deep learning
   * Perhaps the most famous of such models is [ELMo (Embeddings from Language
     Models)](https://allennlp.org/elmo) by AI2, which learned bidirectional word
     embeddings using LSTMs, and began NLP's fondness of Sesame Street.
   * I won't go into much more detail here: partly because not all of these approaches
     have held up as well as current Transformer-based models, and partly because I have
     plans for my computer that don't involve blogging about recent advances in NLP.
   * Here is [a survey paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02709) (and an [associated blog
     post](https://medium.com/dair-ai/deep-learning-for-nlp-an-overview-of-recent-trends-d0d8f40a776d))
     published shortly after the Transformer was invented, which summarizes a lot of the
     work that was being done during this period.

1. Transformer
   * The authors introduce a feed-forward network architecture, using only attention
     mechanisms and dispensing with convolutions and recurrence entirely (which were not
     uncommon techniques in NLP at the time).
   * It achieved state-of-the-art performance on several tasks, and (perhaps more
     importantly) was found to generalize very well to other NLP tasks, even with
     limited data.
   * Since this architecture was the progenitor of so many other NLP models, it's
     worthwhile to dig into the details a bit. The architecture is illustrated below:
     note that its feed-forward nature and multi-head self attention are critical
     aspects of this architecture!

1. ULMFiT (Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification)
   * The authors introduce an effective transfer learning method that can be applied to
     any task in NLP: this paper introduced the idea of general-domain, unsupervised
     pre-training, followed by task-specific fine-tuning. They also introduce other
     techniques that are fairly common in NLP now, such as slanted triangular learning
     rate schedules. (what some researchers now call warm-up).

1. GPT-1 and GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformers)
   * At the risk of peeking ahead, GPT is largely BERT but with Transformer decoder
     blocks, instead of encoder blocks. Note that in doing this, we lose the
     autoregressive/unidirectional nature of the model.
   * Arguably the main contribution of GPT-2 is that it demonstrated the value of
     training larger Transformer models (a trend that I personally refer to as the
     _Embiggening_).
   * GPT-2 generated some controversy, as OpenAI [initially refused to open-source the
     model](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224704/ai-machine-learning-language-models-read-write-openai-gpt2),
     citing potential malicious uses, but [ended up releasing the model
     later](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953040/openai-text-generation-ai-gpt-2-full-model-release-1-5b-parameters).

6. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
   * The authors use the Transformer encoder (and only the encoder) to pre-train deep
     bidirectional representations from unlabeled text. This pre-trained BERT model can
     then be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to achieve
     state-of-the-art performance for many NLP tasks, without substantial task-specific
     architecture changes, as illustrated below.

   * BERT was a drastic development in the NLP landscape: it became almost a cliche to
     conclude that BERT performs "surprisingly well" on whatever task or dataset you
     throw at it.

     + [_The Illustrated BERT_ blog post](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/)

1. RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach)
   * The scientific contributions of this paper are best quoted from its abstract:

     > We find that BERT was significantly under-trained, and can match or exceed the
     > performance of every model published after it. [...] These results highlight the
     > importance of previously overlooked design choices, and raise questions about the
     > source of recently reported improvements.

   * The authors use an identical architecture to BERT, but propose several improvements
     to the training routine, such as changing the dataset and removing the
     next-sentence-prediction (NSP) pre-training task. Funnily enough, far and away the
     best thing the authors did to improve BERT was just the most obvious thing: train
     BERT for longer!

1. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
   * There are two main contributions of this paper:
     1. The authors recast all NLP tasks into a text-to-text format: for example,
        instead of performing a two-way softmax for binary classification, one could
        simply teach an NLP model to output the tokens "spam" or "ham". This provides a
        unified text-to-text format for all NLP tasks.
     1. The authors systematically study and compare the effects of pre-training
        objectives, architectures, unlabeled datasets, transfer approaches, and other
        factors on dozens of canonical NLP tasks.
   * This paper (and especially the tables in the appendices!) probably cost the Google
     team an incredible amount of money, and the authors were very thorough in ablating
     what does and doesn't help for a good NLP system.

## Some Thoughts and Observations

Here I comment on some general trends that I see in Transformer-based models in NLP.

1. Ever since Google developed the Transformer in 2017, most NLP contributions are not
   architectural: instead most recent advances have used the Transformer model as-is, or
   using some subset of the Transformer (e.g. BERT and GPT use exclusively Transformer
   encoder and decoder blocks, respectively). Instead, recent research has focused on
   the way NLP models are pre-trained or fine-tuned, or creating a new dataset, or
   formulating a new NLP task to measure "language understanding", etc.
   * I'm personally not sure what to make of this development: why did we collectively
     agree that architectural research wasn't worth pursuing anymore?
   * But spinning this the other way, we see that Transformers are a _fascinating_
     architecture: the model has proven so surprisingly versatile and easy to teach that
     we are still making meaningful advances with the same architecture. In fact, it is
     still an open question how and why Transformers perform as well as they do: there
     is an open field of research focusing on answering this question for BERT (since
     BERT has been uniquely successful model) called
     [BERTology](https://huggingface.co/transformers/bertology.html).

1. It was never a question of _whether_ NLP systems would follow computer vision's model
   of fine-tuning pre-trained models (i.e. training a model on ImageNet and then doing
   task-specific fine-tuning for downstream applications), but rather _how_.
   1. What specific task and/or dataset should NLP models be pre-trained on?
      * Language modelling has really won out here: BERT was originally published with a
        _next-sentence prediction_ (NSP) pre-training task, which RoBERTa completely did
        away with.
   1. Exactly _what_ is being learnt during pre-training?
      * Initially it was a separate vector for each token (i.e. pre-training a shallow
        representation of text), and these days it is an entire network is pre-trained.
      * Sebastian Ruder [wrote a great article](https://thegradient.pub/nlp-imagenet/)
        that delves more into this topic.

1. There are (generally speaking) three flavors of Transformer models.
   1. Autoregressive models
   1. Autoencoding models
   1. Sequence-to-sequence models
   - Hugging Face does an excellent job of summarizing the differences between these
     three flavors of models in [their _Summary of the
     Models_](https://huggingface.co/transformers/summary.html), which I've reproduced
     here:

   > Autoregressive models are pretrained on the classic language modeling task: guess
   > the next token having read all the previous ones. They correspond to the decoder of
   > the original transformer model, and a mask is used on top of the full sentence so
   > that the attention heads can only see what was before in the next, and not what’s
   > after. Although those models can be fine-tuned and achieve great results on many
   > tasks, the most natural application is text generation. A typical example of such
   > models is GPT.
   > 
   > Autoencoding models are pretrained by corrupting the input tokens in some way and
   > trying to reconstruct the original sentence. They correspond to the encoder of the
   > original transformer model in the sense that they get access to the full inputs
   > without any mask. Those models usually build a bidirectional representation of the
   > whole sentence. They can be fine-tuned and achieve great results on many tasks such
   > as text generation, but their most natural application is sentence classification
   > or token classification. A typical example of such models is BERT.

   > 
   > Sequence-to-sequence models use both the encoder and the decoder of the original
   > transformer, either for translation tasks or by transforming other tasks to
   > sequence-to-sequence problems. They can be fine-tuned to many tasks but their most
   > natural applications are translation, summarization and question answering. The
   > original transformer model is an example of such a model (only for translation), T5
   > is an example that can be fine-tuned on other tasks.

1. Different NLP models learn different kinds of embeddings, and it's worth
   understanding the differences between these various learnt representations.
   1. Contextual vs non-contextual embeddings
      * The first word embeddings (that is, word2vec and GloVe) were _non-contextual_:
        each word had its own embedding, independent of the words that came before or
        after it.
      * Almost all other embeddings are _contextual_ now: when embedding a token, they
        also consider the tokens before &/ after it.
   1. Unidirectional vs bidirectional embeddings
      * When considering the context of a token, the question is whether you should
        consider the tokens both before and after it (i.e. bidirectional embeddings), or
        just the tokens that came before (i.e. unidirectional embeddings).
      * Unidirectional embeddings make the sense when generating text (i.e. text
        generation must be done in the way humans write text: in one direction). On the
        other hand, bidirectional embeddings make sense when performing sentence-level
        tasks such as summarization or rewriting.
      * The Transformer was notable in that it had bidirectional encoder blocks and
        unidirectional decoder blocks. That's why BERT [GPT-2] produces bidirectional
        [unidirectional] embeddings, since it's a stack of Transformer encoders
        [decoders].
      * Note that the unidirectional/bidirectional distinction is related to whether or
        not the model is autoregressive: autoregressive models learn unidirectional
        embeddings.

1. Transformer-based models have had an interesting history with scaling.
   - This trend probably started when GPT-2 was published: "it sounds very dumb and too
     easy, but magical things happen if you make your Transformer model bigger".
   - An open question is, how do Transformer models scale (along any dimension of
     interest)? For example, how much does dataset size or the number of layers or the
     number of training iterations matter in the ultimate performance of a Transformer
     model? At what point does making your Transformer model "bigger" (along any
     dimension of interest) provide diminishing returns?
   - There is some [solid
     work](https://github.com/huggingface/awesome-papers#march-24-2020) being done to
     answer this question, and there seems to be good evidence for some fairly
     surprising conclusions!

[^1]: Since writing this blog post, there have been several more Transformer-based NLP models published, such as the [Reformer](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/reformer-efficient-transformer.html) from Google and [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) from OpenAI. Because I can't possibly keep up with _all_ new Transformer-based models, I won't be writing about them.
