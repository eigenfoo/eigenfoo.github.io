An exciting professional update: today is my last day at
[Point72](https://www.point72.com/) and next month I’ll be joining [Flatiron
Health](https://flatiron.com/) as a data scientist on their machine learning
team! I'll be working out of their SoHo offices, and will continue to be based
in New York.

Flatiron Health is a technology company in the healthcare space, trying to
accelerate oncology research and improve quality of cancer care through data
analytics.

The past two years have been terrific, but needless to say, I'm looking forward
to adventures ahead! ⛵
