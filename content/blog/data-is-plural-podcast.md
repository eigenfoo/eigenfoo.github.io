I was on a podcast!

Check out [the latest episode of the Data Is Plural
postcast](https://podcast.data-is-plural.com/2159594/14179132-s2e5-crosswords)
to hear me and fellow crossword archivist [Saul Pwanson](http://saul.pw/) talk
about our respective crossword datasets. I also opine a bit on milk carton data
collection, and I'm [only now
realizing](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/30/a-national-milk-carton-shortage-sours-americas-dairy-industry)
how prescient those comments were! [^1]

For more, check out [my previous blog post](/cryptic-clues/) introducing the
dataset, [the dataset itself](https://cryptics.georgeho.org/) or [the source
code.](https://github.com/eigenfoo/cryptics)

[^1]: I mean, just listen to this:

    > [Pactiv Evergreen, a milk carton supplier,] has ... resurrected a defunct
    > generic brand and will use its design for all cartons, rather than
    > interrupting the line to change logos. This should speed [milk]
    > production and increase capacity by 10%.

    Wouldn't that be cool to see in a dataset?
