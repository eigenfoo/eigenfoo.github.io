My current project involves working with deep autoregressive models: a class of
remarkable neural networks that aren't usually seen on a first pass through deep
learning. These notes are a quick write-up of my reading and research: I assume
basic familiarity with deep learning, and aim to highlight general trends and
similarities across autoregressive models, instead of commenting on individual
architectures.

**tldr:** _Deep autoregressive models are sequence models, yet feed-forward
(i.e. not recurrent); generative models, yet supervised. They are a compelling
alternative to RNNs for sequential data, and GANs for generation tasks._

## Deep Autoregressive Models

To be explicit (at the expense of redundancy), this blog post is about _deep
autoregressive generative sequence models_. That's quite a mouthful of jargon
(and two of those words are actually unnecessary), so let's unpack that.

1. Deep
   * Well, these papers are using TensorFlow or PyTorch... so they must be
     "deep" 😉
   * You would think this word is unnecessary, but it's actually not!
     Autoregressive linear models like
     [ARMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive%E2%80%93moving-average_model)
     or
     [ARCH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_conditional_heteroskedasticity)
     have been used in statistics, econometrics and financial modelling for
     ages.

1. Autoregressive
   * [Stanford has a good
     introduction](https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/notes/autoregressive/)
     to autoregressive models, but I think a good way to explain these models is
     to compare them to recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are far more
     well-known.

     </figure>

     * Like an RNN, an autoregressive model's output $h_t$ at time $t$
       depends on not just $x_t$, but also $x$'s from previous time steps.
       However, _unlike_ an RNN, the previous $x$'s are not provided via some
       hidden state: they are given as just another input to the model.
     * The following animation of Google DeepMind's WaveNet illustrates this
       well: the $t$th output is generated in a _feed-forward_ fashion from
       several input $x$ values.[^1]

       </figure>

     * Put simply, **an autoregressive model is merely a feed-forward model which
       predicts future values from past values.**
     * I'll explain this more later, but it's worth saying now: autoregressive
       models offer a compelling bargain. You can have stable, parallel and
       easy-to-optimize training, faster inference computations, and completely
       do away with the fickleness of [truncated backpropagation through
       time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation_through_time), if you
       are willing to accept a model that (by design) _cannot have_ infinite
       memory. There is [recent
       research](http://www.offconvex.org/2018/07/27/approximating-recurrent/) to
       suggest that this is a worthwhile tradeoff.

1. Generative
   * Informally, a generative model is one that can generate new data after
     learning from the dataset.
   * More formally, a generative model models the joint distribution $P(X, Y)$
     of the observation $X$ and the target $Y$. Contrast this to a
     discriminative model that models the conditional distribution $P(Y|X)$.
   * GANs and VAEs are two families of popular generative models.
   * This is unnecessary word #1: any autoregressive model can be run
     sequentially to generate a new sequence! Start with your seed $x_1, x_2,
     ..., x_k$ and predict $x_{k+1}$. Then use $x_2, x_3, ..., x_{k+1}$ to
     predict $x_{k+2}$, and so on.

1. Sequence model
   * Fairly self explanatory: a model that deals with sequential data, whether
     it is mapping sequences to scalars (e.g. language models), or mapping
     sequences to sequences (e.g. machine translation models).
   * Although sequence models are designed for sequential data (duh), there has
     been success at applying them to non-sequential data. For example,
     PixelCNN (discussed below) can generate entire images, even though images
     are not sequential in nature: the model generates a pixel at a time, in
     sequence![^2]
   * Notice that an autoregressive model must be a sequence model, so it's
     redundant to further describe these models as sequential (which makes this
     unnecessary word #2).

A good distinction is that "generative" and "sequential" describe _what_ these
models do, or what kind of data they deal with. "Autoregressive" describes _how_
these models do what they do: i.e. they describe properties of the network or
its architecture.

## Some Architectures and Applications

Deep autoregressive models have seen a good degree of success: below is a list
of some of examples. Each architecture merits exposition and discussion, but
unfortunately there isn't enough space here to devote to do any of them justice.

* [PixelCNN by Google DeepMind](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759) was probably
  the first deep autoregressive model, and the progenitor of most of the other
  models below. Ironically, the authors spend the bulk of the paper discussing a
  recurrent model, PixelRNN, and consider PixelCNN as a "workaround" to avoid
  excessive computation. However, PixelCNN is probably this paper's most lasting
  contribution.
* [PixelCNN++ by OpenAI](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05517) is, unsurprisingly,
  PixelCNN but with various improvements.
* [WaveNet by Google
  DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/) is
  heavily inspired by PixelCNN, and models raw audio, not just encoded music.
  They had to pull [a neat trick from telecommunications/signals
  processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C-law_algorithm) in order to
  cope with the sheer size of audio (high-quality audio involves at least 16-bit
  precision samples, which means a 65,536-way-softmax per time step!)
* [Transformer, a.k.a. _the "attention is all you need" model_ by Google
  Brain](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) is now a mainstay of NLP, performing
  very well at many NLP tasks and being incorporated into subsequent models like
  [BERT](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html).

These models have also found applications: for example, [Google DeepMind's
ByteNet can perform neural machine translation (in linear
time!)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.10099) and [Google DeepMind's Video Pixel
Network can model video](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00527).[^3]

## Some Thoughts and Observations

1. Given previous values $x_1, x_2, ..., x_t$, these models do not output a
   _value_ for $x_{t+1}$, they output the _predictive probability
   distribution_ $P(x_{t+1} | x_1, x_2, ..., x_t)$ for $x_{t+1}$.
   * If the $x$'s are discrete, then you can do this by outputting an $N$-way
     softmaxxed tensor, where $N$ is the number of discrete classes. This is
     what the original PixelCNN did, but gets problematic when $N$ is large
     (e.g. in the case of WaveNet, where $N = 2^{16}$).
   * If the $x$'s are continuous, you can model the probability distribution
     itself as the sum of basis functions, and having the model output the
     parameters of these basis functions. This massively reduces the memory
     footprint of the model, and was an important contribution of PixelCNN++.
   * Theoretically you could have an autoregressive model that _doesn't_ model
     the conditional distribution... but most recent models do.

1. Autoregressive models are supervised.
   * With the success and hype of GANs and VAEs, it is easy to assume that all
     generative models are unsupervised: this is not true!
   * This means that that training is stable and highly parallelizable, that it
     is straightfoward to tune hyperparameters, and that inference is
     computationally inexpensive. We can also break out all the good stuff from
     ML-101: train-valid-test splits, cross validation, loss metrics, etc. These
     are all things that we lose when we resort to e.g. GANs.

1. Autoregressive models work on both continuous and discrete data.
   * Autoregressive sequential models have worked for audio (WaveNet), images
     (PixelCNN++) and text (Transformer): these models are very flexible in the
     kind of data that they can model.
   * Contrast this to GANs, which (as far as I'm aware) cannot model discrete
     data.

1. Autoregressive models are very amenable to conditioning.
   * There are many options for conditioning! You can condition on both discrete
     and continuous variables; you can condition at multiple time scales; you can
     even condition on latent embeddings or the outputs of other neural networks.
   * There is one ostensible problem with using autoregressive models as
     generative models: you can only condition on your data's labels. I.e.
     unlike a GAN, you cannot condition on random noise and expect the model to
     shape the noise space into a semantically (stylistically) meaningful latent
     space.
   * Google DeepMind followed up their original PixelRNN paper with [another
     paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05328) that describes one way to overcome
     this problem. Briefly: to condition, they incorporate the latent vector into
     the PixelCNN's activation functions; to produce/learn the latent vectors,
     they use a convolutional encoder; and to generate an image given a latent
     vector, they replace the traditional deconvolutional decoder with a
     conditional PixelCNN.
   * WaveNet goes even futher and employs "global" and "local" conditioning (both
     are achieved by incorporating the latent vectors into WaveNet's activation
     functions). The authors devise a battery of conditioning schemes to capture
     speaker identity, linguistic features of input text, music genre, musical
     instrument, etc.

1. Generating output sequences of variable length is not straightforward.
   * Neither WaveNet nor PixelCNN needed to worry about a variable output length:
     both audio and images are comprised of a fixed number of outputs (i.e. audio
     is just $N$ samples, and images are just $N^2$ pixels).
   * Text, on the other hand, is different: sentences can be of variable length.
     One would think that this is a nail in a coffin, but thankfully text is
     discrete: the standard trick is to have a "stop token" that indicates that
     the sentence is finished (i.e. model a full stop as its own token).
   * As far as I am aware, there is no prior literature on having both problems:
     a variable-length output of continuous values.

1. Autoregressive models can model multiple time scales
   * In the case of music, there are important patterns to model at multiple
     time scales: individual musical notes drive correlations between audio
     samples at the millisecond scale, and music exhibits rhythmic patterns
     over the course of minutes. This is well illustrated by the following
     animation:
 
     <figure>
       <a href="/assets/images/audio-animation.gif"><img src="/assets/images/audio-animation.gif" alt="Audio at multiple time scales"></a>
       <figcaption>Audio exhibits patterns at multiple time scales. Source: <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/">Google DeepMind</a>.</figcaption>
     </figure>

   * There are two main ways model many patterns at many different time scales:
     either make the receptive field of your model _extremely_ wide (e.g.
     through dilated convolutions), or condition your model on a subsampled
     version of your generated output, which is in turn produced by an
     unconditioned model.
     * Google DeepMind composes an unconditional PixelRNN with one or more
       conditional PixelRNNs to form a so-called "multi-scale" PixelRNN: the
       first PixelRNN generates a lower-resolution image that conditions the
       subsequent PixelRNNs.
     * WaveNet employs a different technique and calls them "context stacks".

1. How the hell can any of this stuff work?
   * RNNs are theoretically more expressive and powerful than autoregressive
     models. However, recent work suggests that such infinite-horizon memory is
     seldom achieved in practice.
   * To quote [John Miller at the Berkeley AI Research
     lab](http://www.offconvex.org/2018/07/27/approximating-recurrent/):
 
     > **Recurrent models trained in practice are effectively feed-forward.**
     > This could happen either because truncated backpropagation through time
     > cannot learn patterns significantly longer than $k$ steps, or, more
     > provocatively, because models _trainable by gradient descent_ cannot have
     > long-term memory.

[^1]: There's actually a lot more nuance than meets the eye in this animation,
  but all I'm trying to illustrate is the feed-forward nature of autoregressive
  models.

[^2]: I personally think it's breathtakingly that machines can do this. Imagine
  your phone keyboard's word suggestions (those are autoregressive!) spitting
  out an entire novel. Or imagine weaving a sweater but you had to choose the
  color of every stitch, in order, in advance.

[^3]: In case you haven't noticed, Google DeepMind seemed to have had an
  infatuation with autoregressive models back in 2016.
