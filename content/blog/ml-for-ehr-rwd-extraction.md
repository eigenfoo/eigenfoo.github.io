My team at [Flatiron Health](https://flatiron.com/) (but especially the
inimitable [Blythe Adamson](https://www.blytheadamson.com/)) recently wrote an
excellent overview of how we use machine learning to build research-ready
oncology datasets from patient medical records --- in a paper called _Approach
to Machine Learning for Extraction of Real-World Data Variables from Electronic
Health Records._

This is a refreshingly simple and concise articulation of what I do at my day
job! You can read the paper on [Frontiers in
Pharmacology](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2023.1180962/full),
[medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.02.23286522v1), or
read [a brief overview on the Flatiron
website](https://flatiron.com/resources/approach-to-machine-learning-for-extraction-of-real-world-data-variables-from-electronic-health-records).

To spare you a few clicks, here's what I think is the most enlightening figure
in the paper:
