“hello world” of computer graphics).

This is the first post of what will (hopefully) be a cool and interesting blog.
Hope you like it!

For those who are interested, this website is based off [the Minimal Mistakes
theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) by Michael Rose, generated
with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), hosted by [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and served using
[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). I've had no complaints with this
blogging stack: the only thing I pay for is the custom
[`eigenfoo.xyz`](https://eigenfoo.xyz/) domain name, which costs the same as
maybe two or three cups of coffee a year.

**Update (2022-03-06):** I've since made several changes to this blog, which
you can read about in [a subsequent blog post](/migrating-to-hugo).
