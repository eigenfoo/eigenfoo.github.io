that a lot of resources out there go something like this:</p><blockquote><p>Check out this thing! It&rsquo;s great at this task! The important task! The one

fast!</p><p>Take this! It&rsquo;s our algorithm/code/paper! We used it to do the thing! And now

what things <em>can</em> do, or what things are <em>good</em> at doing. Whenever I actually
implement the hyped-up “thing”, I’m invariably frustrated when it doesn’t
perform so well as originally described.</p><p>Maybe I&rsquo;m not smart enough to see this, but after I learn about a new technique
or tool or model, it&rsquo;s not immediately obvious to me when <em>not</em> to use it. I
think it would be very helpful to learn what things <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> good at doing, or
why things just plain <em>suck</em> at times. Doing so not only helps you understand
the technique/tool/model better, but also sharpens your understanding of your
use case and the task at hand: what is it about your application that makes it
unsuitable for such a technique?</p><p>Which is why I&rsquo;m writing the first of what will (hopefully) be a series of posts
on <em>“Why [Thing] Sucks”</em>. The title is provocative but reductive: a better name
might be <em>When and Why [Thing] Might Suck</em>… but that doesn&rsquo;t have quite the
same ring to it! In these articles I&rsquo;ll be outlining what I tried and why it
didn&rsquo;t work: documenting my failures and doing a quick post-mortem, if you will.
My hope is that this will be useful to anyone else trying to do the same thing
I&rsquo;m doing.</p><hr><p>So first up: topic modelling. Specifically, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation>latent Dirichlet
allocation</a>, or LDA
for short (not to be confused with <a href=https://www.georgeho.org/lda/>the other
LDA</a>, which I wrote a blog post about before).</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve already encountered LDA and have seen <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_notation>plate
notation</a> before, this picture
will probably refresh your memory:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/latent-dirichlet-allocation.png alt="Latent Dirichlet allocation"></p><p>If you don&rsquo;t know what LDA is, fret not, for there is

I&rsquo;m going to move on to when and why LDA isn&rsquo;t the best idea.</p><p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> <em>LDA and topic modelling doesn&rsquo;t work well with a) short documents,
in which there isn&rsquo;t much text to model, or b) documents that don&rsquo;t coherently
discuss a single topic.</em></p><p>Wait, what? Did George just say that topic modelling sucks when there&rsquo;s not much
topic, and not much text to model? Isn&rsquo;t that obvious?</p><p><em>Yes! Exactly!</em> Of course it&rsquo;s <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_of_Columbus>obvious in
retrospect</a>! Which is why I was
so upset when I realized I spent two whole weeks faffing around with LDA when
topic models were the opposite of what I needed, and so frustrated that more
people aren&rsquo;t talking about when <em>not</em> to use/do certain things.</p><p>But anyways, <code>&lt;\rant></code> and let&rsquo;s move on to why I say what I&rsquo;m saying.</p><p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve taken up a project in modelling the textual data on Reddit using
NLP techniques. There are, of course, many ways one count take this, but
something I was interested in was finding similarities between subreddits,
clustering comments, and visualizing these clusters somehow: what does Reddit
talk about on average? Of course, I turned to topic modelling and dimensionality
reduction.</p><p>The techniques that I came across first were LDA (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation>latent Dirichlet
allocation</a>) and
t-SNE (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding>t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding</a>).
Both techniques are well known and well documented, but I can&rsquo;t say that using
them together is a popular choice of two techniques. However, there have been
some successes. For instance, <code>ShuaiW</code> had some success with this method <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219104016/https://shuaiw.github.io/2016/12/22/topic-modeling-and-tsne-visualzation.html>when
using it the 20 newsgroups
dataset</a><sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>;
some work done by Kagglers have <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/ykhorramz/lda-and-t-sne-interactive-visualization>yielded reasonable
results</a>,
and <a href=https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/305356/plot-latent-dirichlet-allocation-output-using-t-sne>the StackExchange community doesn&rsquo;t think its a ridiculous
idea</a>.</p><p>The dataset that I applied this technique to was the <a href=https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/fh-bigquery:reddit>Reddit dataset on Google
BigQuery</a>, which contains
data on all subreddits, posts and comments for as long as Reddit has been around.
I limited myself to the top 10 most active subreddits in December 2017 (the most
recent month for which we have data, at the time of writing), and chose 20 to be
the number of topics to model (any choice is as arbitrary as any other).</p><p>I ran LDA and t-SNE exactly as Shuai described on <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219104016/https://shuaiw.github.io/2016/12/22/topic-modeling-and-tsne-visualzation.html>this blog
post</a><sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>,
except using the great <a href=https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/><code>gensim</code></a> library to
perform LDA, which was built with large corpora and efficient online algorithms
in mind. (Specifically, <code>gensim</code> implements online variational inference with
the EM algorthm, instead of using MCMC-based algorithms, which <code>lda</code> does. It
seems that variational Bayes scales better to very large corpora than collapsed
Gibbs sampling.)</p><p>Here are the results:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/lda-sucks.png alt="LDA followed by t-SNE on the Reddit dataset"></p><p>Horrible, right? Nowhere near the well-separated clusters that Shuai got with
the 20 newsgroups. In fact, the tiny little huddles of around 5 to 10 comments
are probably artifacts of the dimensionality reduction done by t-SNE, so those
might even just be noise! You might say that there are at least 3 very large
clusters, but even that&rsquo;s bad news! If they&rsquo;re clustered together, you would
hope that they have the same topics, and that&rsquo;s definitely not the case here!
These large clusters tells us that a lot of comments have roughly the same topic
distribution (i.e. they&rsquo;re close to each other in the high-dimensional
topic-space), but their dominant topics (i.e. the topic with greatest
probability) don&rsquo;t end up being the same.</p><p>By the way, t-SNE turns out to be <a href=https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/>a really devious dimensionality reduction
technique</a>, and you really need to
experiment with the perplexity values in order to use it properly. I used the
default <code>perplexity=30</code> from sklearn for the previous plot, but I repeated the
visualizations for multiple other values and the results aren&rsquo;t so hot either.
Note that I did these on a random subsample of 1000 comments, so as to reduce
compute time.</p><figure><a href=/assets/images/perplexity50.png><img src=/assets/images/perplexity50.png alt="t-SNE with perplexity value of 50"></a>

There&rsquo;s a <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29786985/whats-the-disadvantage-of-lda-for-short-texts>nice StackOverflow
post</a>
that describes the problem well.</p><p>Firstly, latent Dirichlet allocation and other probabilistic topic models are
very complex and flexible. While this means that they have very high variance
and low bias, it also means that they need a lot of data (or data with a decent
signal-to-noise ratio) for them to learn anything meaningful. Particularly for
LDA, which infers topics on a document-by-document basis, if there aren&rsquo;t enough
words in a document, there simply isn&rsquo;t enough data to infer a reliable topic
distribution for that document.</p><p>Secondly, Reddit comments are by their nature very short and very-context
dependent, since they respond to a post, or another comment. So not only are
Reddit comments just short: it&rsquo;s actually worse than that! They don&rsquo;t even
discuss a certain topic coherently (by which I mean, they don&rsquo;t necessarily use
words that pertain to what they&rsquo;re talking about). I&rsquo;ll give an example:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>&#34;I&#39;m basing my knowledge on the fact that I watched the fucking rock fall.&#34;
</code></pre><p>Now, stopwords compose a little less than half of this comment, and they would
be stripped before LDA even looks at it. But that aside, what is this comment
about? What does the rock falling mean? What knowledge is this user claiming?
It&rsquo;s a very confusing comment, but probably made complete sense in the context
of the post it responded to and the comments that came before it. As it is,
however, its impossible for <em>me</em> to figure out what topic this comment is about,
let alone an algorithm!</p><p>Also, just to drive the point home, here are the top 10 words in each of the 20
topics that LDA came up with, on the same dataset as before:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Topic #0:
  got just time day like went friend told didn kids

Topic #1:
  just gt people say right doesn know law like government

Topic #2:
  removed com https www https www tax money http watch news

Topic #3:
  people don just like think really good know want things

Topic #4:
  years time did great ago ve just work life damn

Topic #5:
  movie like love just really school star movies film story

Topic #6:
  like just fucking shit head car looks new makes going

Topic #7:
  game team season year good win play teams playing best

Topic #8:
  right thing yeah don think use internet ok water case

Topic #9:
  going like work just need way want money free fuck

Topic #10:
  better just play games make ve ll seen lol fun

Topic #11:
  like don know did feel shit big man didn guys

Topic #12:
  deleted fuck guy year old man amp year old state lmao

Topic #13:
  sure believe trump wrong saying comment post mueller evidence gt

Topic #14:
  gt yes https com good oh wikipedia org en wiki

Topic #15:
  think like good 10 look point lebron just pretty net

Topic #16:
  gt said fucking american agree trump thanks obama states did

Topic #17:
  trump vote party republicans election moore president republican democrats won

Topic #18:
  war world country israel countries china military like happy does

Topic #19:
  reddit message askreddit post questions com reddit com subreddit compose message compose
</code></pre><p>Now, it&rsquo;s not entirely bad: topic 2 seems like its collecting the tokens from links
(I didn&rsquo;t stopword those out, oops), topic 7 looks like its about football or
some other sport, 13 is probably about American politics, and 18 looks like
its about world news, etc.</p><p>But almost all other topics are just collections of words: it&rsquo;s not immediately
obvious to me what each topic represents.</p><p>So yeah, there you have it, LDA really sucks sometimes.</p><hr><p><strong>Update (8/12/2018):</strong> In retrospect, I think that this whole blog post is
summarized well in the following tweet thread. Clustering algorithms will give
you clusters because that&rsquo;s what they do, not because there actually <em>are</em>
clusters. In this case, extremely short and context-dependent documents make it
hard to justify that there are topic clusters in the first place.</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet data-lang=en><p lang=en dir=ltr>Algorithms that have to report something will always report something, even if it's a bad idea.
