<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve started using <a href=https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3>PyMC3</a> for
Bayesian modelling, and it&rsquo;s an amazing piece of software! The API only exposes
as much of heavy machinery of MCMC as you need — by which I mean, just the
<code>pm.sample()</code> method (a.k.a., as <a href=http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2013/08/12/bayesian-glms-1/>Thomas
Wiecki</a> puts it, the
<em>Magic Inference Button™</em>). This really frees up your mind to think about your
data and model, which is really the heart and soul of data science!</p><p>That being said however, I quickly realized that the water gets very deep very
fast: I explored my data set, specified a hierarchical model that made sense to
me, hit the <em>Magic Inference Button™</em>, and… uh, what now? I blinked at the
angry red warnings the sampler spat out.</p><p>So began by long, rewarding and ongoing exploration of Bayesian modelling. This
is a compilation of notes, tips, tricks and recipes that I&rsquo;ve collected from
everywhere: papers, documentation, peppering my <a href=https://twitter.com/twiecki>more
experienced</a>
<a href=https://twitter.com/aseyboldt>colleagues</a> with questions. It&rsquo;s still very much
a work in progress, but hopefully somebody else finds it useful!</p><p><img src=/assets/images/pymc-logo.png alt="PyMC logo"></p><div>

<li>First of all, <em>welcome!</em> It&rsquo;s a brave new world out there — where statistics
is cool, Bayesian and (if you&rsquo;re lucky) even easy. Dive in!</li></ul><blockquote>
<p><strong>EDIT (1/24/2020):</strong> I published a <a href=https://www.georgeho.org/bayesian-inference-reading/>subsequent blog
post</a> with a reading list
for Bayesian inference and modelling. Check it out for reading material in
addition to the ones I list below!</p></blockquote><h3 id=bayesian-modelling>Bayesian modelling</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know any probability, I&rsquo;d recommend <a href=https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/probability_theory.html>Michael
Betancourt&rsquo;s</a>
crash-course in practical probability theory.</p></li><li>
<p>For an introduction to general Bayesian methods and modelling, I really liked
<a href=http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/>Cam Davidson Pilon&rsquo;s <em>Bayesian Methods for
Hackers</em></a>:
it really made the whole “thinking like a Bayesian” thing click for me.</p></li><li>
<p>If you&rsquo;re willing to spend some money, I&rsquo;ve heard that <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/><em>Doing Bayesian Data
Analysis</em> by
Kruschke</a> (a.k.a.
<em>“the puppy book”</em>) is for the bucket list.</p></li><li>
<p>Here we come to a fork in the road. The central problem in Bayesian modelling
is this: given data and a probabilistic model that we think models this data,
how do we find the posterior distribution of the model&rsquo;s parameters? There are
currently two good solutions to this problem. One is Markov-chain Monte Carlo
sampling (a.k.a. MCMC sampling), and the other is variational inference
(a.k.a. VI). Both methods are mathematical Death Stars: extremely powerful but
incredibly complicated. Nevertheless, I think it&rsquo;s important to get at least a
hand-wavy understanding of what these methods are. If you&rsquo;re new to all this,
my personal recommendation is to invest your time in learning MCMC: it&rsquo;s been
around longer, we know that there are sufficiently robust tools to help you,
and there&rsquo;s a lot more support/documentation out there.</p></li></ul><h3 id=markov-chain-monte-carlo>Markov-chain Monte Carlo</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>For a good high-level introduction to MCMC, I liked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ0c7Bm5Djk&feature=youtu.be&t=4h40m9s">Michael Betancourt&rsquo;s
StanCon 2017
talk</a>:
especially the first few minutes where he provides a motivation for MCMC, that
really put all this math into context for me.</p></li><li>
<p>For a more in-depth (and mathematical) treatment of MCMC, I&rsquo;d check out his
<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02434>paper on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id=variational-inference>Variational inference</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>VI has been around for a while, but it was only in 2017 (2 years ago, at the
time of writing) that <em>automatic differentiation variational inference</em> was
invented. As such, variational inference is undergoing a renaissance and is
currently an active area of statistical research. Since it&rsquo;s such a nascent
field, most resources on it are very theoretical and academic in nature.</p></li><li>
<p>Chapter 10 (on approximate inference) in Bishop&rsquo;s <em>Pattern Recognition and
Machine Learning</em> and <a href=https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall11/cos597C/lectures/variational-inference-i.pdf>this
tutorial</a>
by David Blei are excellent, if a bit mathematically-intensive, resources.</p></li><li>
<p>The most hands-on explanation of variational inference I&rsquo;ve seen is the docs
for <a href=http://pyro.ai/examples/svi_part_i.html>Pyro</a>, a probabilistic
programming language developed by Uber that specializes in variational
inference.</p></li></ul><h2 id=model-formulation>Model Formulation</h2><ul>
<li>
<p>Try thinking about <em>how</em> your data would be generated: what kind of machine
has your data as outputs? This will help you both explore your data, as well
as help you arrive at a reasonable model formulation.</p></li><li>
<p>Try to avoid correlated variables. Some of the more robust samplers can cope
with <em>a posteriori</em> correlated random variables, but sampling is much easier
for everyone involved if the variables are uncorrelated. By the way, the bar
is pretty low here: if the jointplot/scattergram of the two variables looks
like an ellipse, thats usually okay. It&rsquo;s when the ellipse starts looking like
a line that you should be alarmed.</p></li><li>
<p>Try to avoid discrete latent variables, and discrete parameters in general.
There is no good method to sample them in a smart way (since discrete
parameters have no gradients); and with “naïve” samplers (i.e. those that do
not take advantage of the gradient), the number of samples one needs to make
good inferences generally scales exponentially in the number of parameters.
For an instance of this, see <a href=https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/marginalized_gaussian_mixture_model.html>this example on marginal Gaussian
mixtures</a>.</p></li><li>
<p>The <a href=https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations>Stan GitHub
wiki</a> has
some excellent recommendations on how to choose good priors. Once you get a
good handle on the basics of using PyMC3, I <em>100% recommend</em> reading this wiki
from start to end: the Stan community has fantastic resources on Bayesian
statistics, and even though their APIs are quite different, the mathematical
theory all translates over.</p></li></ul><h3 id=hierarchical-models>Hierarchical models</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>First of all, hierarchical models can be amazing! <a href=https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/GLM-hierarchical.html>The PyMC3
docs</a> opine on this at
length, so let&rsquo;s not waste any digital ink.</p></li><li>
<p>The poster child of a Bayesian hierarchical model looks something like this
(equations taken from
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_hierarchical_modeling>Wikipedia</a>):</p><p><img style=float:center src=https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/765f37f86fa26bef873048952dccc6e8067b78f4 alt="Example Bayesian hierarchical model equation #1"></p><p><img style=float:center src=https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca8c0e1233fd69fa4325c6eacf8462252ed6b00a alt="Example Bayesian hierarchical model equation #2"></p><p><img style=float:center src=https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e56b3077b1b3ec867d6a0f2539ba9a3e79b45c1 alt="Example Bayesian hierarchical model equation #3"></p><p>This hierarchy has 3 levels (some would say it has 2 levels, since there are
only 2 levels of parameters to infer, but honestly whatever: by my count there
are 3). 3 levels is fine, but add any more levels, and it becomes harder for
to sample. Try out a taller hierarchy to see if it works, but err on the side
of 3-level hierarchies.</p></li><li>
<p>If your hierarchy is too tall, you can truncate it by introducing a
deterministic function of your parameters somewhere (this usually turns out to
just be a sum). For example, instead of modelling your observations are drawn
from a 4-level hierarchy, maybe your observations can be modeled as the sum of
three parameters, where these parameters are drawn from a 3-level hierarchy.</p></li><li>
<p>More in-depth treatment here in <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0906>(Betancourt and Girolami,
2013)</a>. <strong>tl;dr:</strong> hierarchical models all
but <em>require</em> you use to use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo; also included are some
practical tips and goodies on how to do that stuff in the real world.</p></li></ul><h2 id=model-implementation>Model Implementation</h2><ul>
<li>
<p>At the risk of overgeneralizing, there are only two things that can go wrong
in Bayesian modelling: either your data is wrong, or your model is wrong. And
it is a hell of a lot easier to debug your data than it is to debug your
model. So before you even try implementing your model, plot histograms of your
data, count the number of data points, drop any NaNs, etc. etc.</p></li><li>
<p>PyMC3 has one quirky piece of syntax, which I tripped up on for a while. It&rsquo;s
described quite well in <a href=http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2014/03/17/bayesian-glms-3/#comment-2213376737>this comment on Thomas Wiecki&rsquo;s
blog</a>.
Basically, suppose you have several groups, and want to initialize several
variables per group, but you want to initialize different numbers of variables
for each group. Then you need to use the quirky <code>variables[index]</code>
notation. I suggest using <code>scikit-learn</code>&rsquo;s <code>LabelEncoder</code> to easily create the
index. For example, to make normally distributed heights for the iris dataset:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e># Different numbers of examples for each species</span>

<p>You might find yourself in a situation in which you want to use a centered
parameterization for a portion of your data set, but a noncentered
parameterization for the rest of your data set (see below for what these
parameterizations are). There&rsquo;s a useful idiom for you here:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span>num_xs <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> <span style=color:#ae81ff>5</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You could even experiment with allowing <code>use_centered</code> to be <em>between</em> 0 and
1, instead of being <em>either</em> 0 or 1!</p></li><li>
<p>I prefer to use the <code>pm.Deterministic</code> function instead of simply using normal
arithmetic operations (e.g. I&rsquo;d prefer to write <code>x = pm.Deterministic('x', y + z)</code> instead of <code>x = y + z</code>). This means that you can index the <code>trace</code> object
later on with just <code>trace['x']</code>, instead of having to compute it yourself with
<code>trace['y'] + trace['z']</code>.</p></li></ul><h2 id=mcmc-initialization-and-sampling>MCMC Initialization and Sampling</h2><ul>
<li>
<p>Have faith in PyMC3&rsquo;s default initialization and sampling settings: someone
much more experienced than us took the time to choose them! NUTS is the most
efficient MCMC sampler known to man, and <code>jitter+adapt_diag</code>… well, you get
the point.</p></li><li>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re truly grasping at straws, a more powerful initialization
setting would be <code>advi</code> or <code>advi+adapt_diag</code>, which uses variational inference
to initialize the sampler. An even better option would be to use
<code>advi+adapt_diag_grad</code> <del>which is (at the time of writing) an experimental
feature in beta</del>.</p></li><li>
<p>Never initialize the sampler with the MAP estimate! In low dimensional
problems the MAP estimate (a.k.a. the mode of the posterior) is often quite a
reasonable point. But in high dimensions, the MAP becomes very strange. Check
out <a href=http://www.inference.vc/high-dimensional-gaussian-distributions-are-soap-bubble/>Ferenc Huszár&rsquo;s blog
post</a>
on high-dimensional Gaussians to see why. Besides, at the MAP all the derivatives
of the posterior are zero, and that isn&rsquo;t great for derivative-based samplers.</p></li></ul><h2 id=mcmc-trace-diagnostics>MCMC Trace Diagnostics</h2><ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ve hit the <em>Magic Inference Button™</em>, and you have a <code>trace</code> object. Now
what? First of all, make sure that your sampler didn&rsquo;t barf itself, and that
your chains are safe for consumption (i.e., analysis).</li></ul><ol>
<li>
<p>Theoretically, run the chain for as long as you have the patience or
resources for. In practice, just use the PyMC3 defaults: 500 tuning
iterations, 1000 sampling iterations.</p></li><li>
<p>Check for divergences. PyMC3&rsquo;s sampler will spit out a warning if there are
diverging chains, but the following code snippet may make things easier:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e># Display the total number and percentage of divergent chains</span>

<p>Check the traceplot (<code>pm.traceplot(trace)</code>). You&rsquo;re looking for traceplots
that look like “fuzzy caterpillars”. If the trace moves into some region and
stays there for a long time (a.k.a. there are some “sticky regions”), that&rsquo;s
cause for concern! That indicates that once the sampler moves into some
region of parameter space, it gets stuck there (probably due to high
curvature or other bad topological properties).</p></li><li>
<p>In addition to the traceplot, there are <a href=https://docs.pymc.io/api/plots.html>a ton of other
plots</a> you can make with your trace:</p><ul>
<li><code>pm.plot_posterior(trace)</code>: check if your posteriors look reasonable.</li><li><code>pm.forestplot(trace)</code>: check if your variables have reasonable credible
intervals, and Gelman–Rubin scores close to 1.</li><li><code>pm.autocorrplot(trace)</code>: check if your chains are impaired by high
autocorrelation. Also remember that thinning your chains is a waste of
time at best, and deluding yourself at worst. See Chris Fonnesbeck&rsquo;s
comment on <a href=https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/issues/23>this GitHub
issue</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/junpenglao/status/1009748562136256512>Junpeng Lao&rsquo;s
reply to Michael Betancourt&rsquo;s
tweet</a></li><li><code>pm.energyplot(trace)</code>: ideally the energy and marginal energy
distributions should look very similar. Long tails in the distribution of
energy levels indicates deteriorated sampler efficiency.</li><li><code>pm.densityplot(trace)</code>: a souped-up version of <code>pm.plot_posterior</code>. It
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be wildly useful unless you&rsquo;re plotting posteriors from
multiple models.</li></ul></li><li>
<p>PyMC3 has a nice helper function to pretty-print a summary table of the
trace: <code>pm.summary(trace)</code> (I usually tack on a <code>.round(2)</code> for my sanity).
Look out for:</p><ul>
<li>the $\hat{R}$ values (a.k.a. the Gelman–Rubin statistic, a.k.a. the
potential scale reduction factor, a.k.a. the PSRF): are they all close to
1? If not, something is <em>horribly</em> wrong. Consider respecifying or
reparameterizing your model. You can also inspect these in the forest plot.</li><li>the sign and magnitude of the inferred values: do they make sense, or are
they unexpected and unreasonable? This could indicate a poorly specified
model. (E.g. parameters of the unexpected sign that have low uncertainties
might indicate that your model needs interaction terms.)</li></ul></li><li>
<p>As a drastic debugging measure, try to <code>pm.sample</code> with <code>draws=1</code>,
<code>tune=500</code>, and <code>discard_tuned_samples=False</code>, and inspect the traceplot.
During the tuning phase, we don&rsquo;t expect to see friendly fuzzy caterpillars,
but we <em>do</em> expect to see good (if noisy) exploration of parameter space. So
if the sampler is getting stuck during the tuning phase, that might explain
why the trace looks horrible.</p></li><li>
<p>If you get scary errors that describe mathematical problems (e.g. <code>ValueError: Mass matrix contains zeros on the diagonal. Some derivatives might always be zero.</code>), then you&rsquo;re <del>shit out of luck</del> exceptionally unlucky: those kinds of
errors are notoriously hard to debug. I can only point to the <a href=http://andrewgelman.com/2008/05/13/the_folk_theore/>Folk Theorem of
Statistical Computing</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re having computational problems, probably your model is wrong.</p></blockquote></li></ol><h3 id=fixing-divergences>Fixing divergences</h3><blockquote>
<p><code>There were N divergences after tuning. Increase 'target_accept' or reparameterize.</code></p><p>— The <em>Magic Inference Button™</em></p></blockquote><ul>
<li>
<p>Divergences in HMC occur when the sampler finds itself in regions of extremely
high curvature (such as the opening of the a hierarchical funnel). Broadly
speaking, the sampler is prone to malfunction in such regions, causing the
sampler to fly off towards to infinity. The ruins the chains by heavily
biasing the samples.</p></li><li>
<p>Remember: if you have even <em>one</em> diverging chain, you should be worried.</p></li><li>
<p>Increase <code>target_accept</code>: usually 0.9 is a good number (currently the default
in PyMC3 is 0.8). This will help get rid of false positives from the test for
divergences. However, divergences that <em>don&rsquo;t</em> go away are cause for alarm.</p></li><li>
<p>Increasing <code>tune</code> can sometimes help as well: this gives the sampler more time
to 1) find the typical set and 2) find good values for the step size, mass
matrix elements, etc. If you&rsquo;re running into divergences, it&rsquo;s always possible
that the sampler just hasn&rsquo;t started the mixing phase and is still trying to
find the typical set.</p></li><li>
<p>Consider a <em>noncentered</em> parameterization. This is an amazing trick: it all
boils down to the familiar equation $X = \sigma Z + \mu$ from STAT 101, but
it honestly works wonders. See <a href=http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2017/02/08/bayesian-hierchical-non-centered/>Thomas Wiecki&rsquo;s blog
post</a>
on it, and <a href=https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/Diagnosing_biased_Inference_with_Divergences.html>this page from the PyMC3
documentation</a>.</p></li><li>
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t work, there may be something wrong with the way you&rsquo;re
thinking about your data: consider reparameterizing your model, or
respecifying it entirely.</p></li></ul><h3 id=other-common-warnings>Other common warnings</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that far and away the worst warning to get is the one about
divergences. While a divergent chain indicates that your inference may be
flat-out <em>invalid</em>, the rest of these warnings indicate that your inference is
merely (lol, “merely”) <em>inefficient</em>.</p></li><li>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the <a href=https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html>Brief Guide to Stan&rsquo;s
Warnings</a> is a tremendous resource for
exactly what kinds of errors you might get when running HMC or NUTS, and how
you should think about them.</p></li><li>
<p><code>The number of effective samples is smaller than XYZ for some parameters.</code></p><ul>
<li>Quoting <a href=https://discourse.pymc.io/t/the-number-of-effective-samples-is-smaller-than-25-for-some-parameters/1050/3>Junpeng Lao on
<code>discourse.pymc3.io</code></a>:
“A low number of effective samples is usually an indication of strong
autocorrelation in the chain.”</li><li>Make sure you&rsquo;re using an efficient sampler like NUTS. (And not, for
instance, Gibbs or Metropolis–Hastings.)</li><li>Tweak the acceptance probability (<code>target_accept</code>) — it should be large
enough to ensure good exploration, but small enough to not reject all
proposals and get stuck.</li></ul></li><li>
<p><code>The gelman-rubin statistic is larger than XYZ for some parameters. This indicates slight problems during sampling.</code></p><ul>
<li>When PyMC3 samples, it runs several chains in parallel. Loosely speaking,
the Gelman–Rubin statistic measures how similar these chains are. Ideally it
should be close to 1.</li><li>Increasing the <code>tune</code> parameter may help, for the same reasons as described
in the <em>Fixing Divergences</em> section.</li></ul></li><li>
<p><code>The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.</code></p><ul>
<li>NUTS puts a cap on the depth of the trees that it evaluates during each
iteration, which is controlled through the <code>max_treedepth</code>. Reaching the
maximum allowable tree depth indicates that NUTS is prematurely pulling the
plug to avoid excessive compute time.</li><li>Yeah, what the <em>Magic Inference Button™</em> says: try increasing
<code>max_treedepth</code> or <code>target_accept</code>.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=model-reparameterization>Model reparameterization</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>Countless warnings have told you to engage in this strange activity of
“reparameterization”. What even is that? Luckily, the <a href=https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/releases>Stan User
Manual</a> (specifically the
<em>Reparameterization and Change of Variables</em> section) has an excellent
explanation of reparameterization, and even some practical tips to help you do
it (although your mileage may vary on how useful those tips will be to you).</p></li><li>
<p>Asides from meekly pointing to other resources, there&rsquo;s not much I can do to
help: this stuff really comes from a combination of intuition, statistical
knowledge and good ol&rsquo; experience. I can, however, cite some examples to give
you a better idea.</p><ul>
<li>The noncentered parameterization is a classic example. If you have a
parameter whose mean and variance you are also modelling, the noncentered
parameterization decouples the sampling of mean and variance from the
sampling of the parameter, so that they are now independent. In this way, we
avoid “funnels”.</li><li>The <a href=http://proceedings.mlr.press/v5/carvalho09a.html><em>horseshoe
distribution</em></a> is known to
be a good shrinkage prior, as it is <em>very</em> spikey near zero, and has <em>very</em>
long tails. However, modelling it using one parameter can give multimodal
posteriors — an exceptionally bad result. The trick is to reparameterize and
model it as the product of two parameters: one to create spikiness at zero,
and one to create long tails (which makes sense: to sample from the
horseshoe, take the product of samples from a normal and a half-Cauchy).</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=model-diagnostics>Model Diagnostics</h2><ul>
<li>Admittedly the distinction between the previous section and this one is
somewhat artificial (since problems with your chains indicate problems with
your model), but I still think it&rsquo;s useful to make this distinction because
these checks indicate that you&rsquo;re thinking about your data in the wrong way,
(i.e. you made a poor modelling decision), and <em>not</em> that the sampler is
having a hard time doing its job.</li></ul><ol>
<li>
<p>Run the following snippet of code to inspect the pairplot of your variables
one at a time (if you have a plate of variables, it&rsquo;s fine to pick a couple
at random). It&rsquo;ll tell you if the two random variables are correlated, and
help identify any troublesome neighborhoods in the parameter space (divergent
samples will be colored differently, and will cluster near such
neighborhoods).</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span>pm<span style=color:#f92672>.</span>pairplot(trace,

</span></span></code></pre></div></li><li>
<p>Look at your posteriors (either from the traceplot, density plots or
posterior plots). Do they even make sense? E.g. are there outliers or long
tails that you weren&rsquo;t expecting? Do their uncertainties look reasonable to
you? If you had <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_notation>a plate</a> of
variables, are their posteriors different? Did you expect them to be that
way? If not, what about the data made the posteriors different? You&rsquo;re the
only one who knows your problem/use case, so the posteriors better look good
to you!</p></li><li>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are four kinds of bad geometries that your posterior
can suffer from:</p><ul>
<li>highly correlated posteriors: this will probably cause divergences or
traces that don&rsquo;t look like “fuzzy caterpillars”. Either look at the
jointplots of each pair of variables, or look at the correlation matrix of
all variables. Try using a centered parameterization, or reparameterize in
some other way, to remove these correlations.</li><li>posteriors that form “funnels”: this will probably cause divergences. Try
using a noncentered parameterization.</li><li>heavy tailed posteriors: this will probably raise warnings about
<code>max_treedepth</code> being exceeded. If your data has long tails, you should
model that with a long-tailed distribution. If your data doesn&rsquo;t have long
tails, then your model is ill-specified: perhaps a more informative prior
would help.</li><li>multimodal posteriors: right now this is pretty much a death blow. At the
time of writing, all samplers have a hard time with multimodality, and
there&rsquo;s not much you can do about that. Try reparameterizing to get a
unimodal posterior. If that&rsquo;s not possible (perhaps you&rsquo;re <em>modelling</em>
multimodality using a mixture model), you&rsquo;re out of luck: just let NUTS
sample for a day or so, and hopefully you&rsquo;ll get a good trace.</li></ul></li><li>
<p>Pick a small subset of your raw data, and see what exactly your model does
with that data (i.e. run the model on a specific subset of your data). I find
that a lot of problems with your model can be found this way.</p></li><li>
<p>Run <a href=https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/posterior_predictive.html><em>posterior predictive
checks</em></a> (a.k.a.
PPCs): sample from your posterior, plug it back in to your model, and
“generate new data sets”. PyMC3 even has a nice function to do all this for
you: <code>pm.sample_ppc</code>. But what do you do with these new data sets? That&rsquo;s a
question only you can answer! The point of a PPC is to see if the generated
data sets reproduce patterns you care about in the observed real data set,
and only you know what patterns you care about. E.g. how close are the PPC
means to the observed sample mean? What about the variance?</p><ul>
<li>For example, suppose you were modelling the levels of radon gas in
different counties in a country (through a hierarchical model). Then you
could sample radon gas levels from the posterior for each county, and take
the maximum within each county. You&rsquo;d then have a distribution of maximum
radon gas levels across counties. You could then check if the <em>actual</em>
maximum radon gas level (in your observed data set) is acceptably within
that distribution. If it&rsquo;s much larger than the maxima, then you would know
that the actual likelihood has longer tails than you assumed (e.g. perhaps
you should use a Student&rsquo;s T instead of a normal?)</li><li>Remember that how well the posterior predictive distribution fits the data
is of little consequence (e.g. the expectation that 90% of the data should
fall within the 90% credible interval of the posterior). The posterior
predictive distribution tells you what values for data you would expect if
we were to remeasure, given that you&rsquo;ve already observed the data you did.
As such, it&rsquo;s informed by your prior as well as your data, and it&rsquo;s not its
job to adequately fit your data!</li></ul></li></ol></content>
