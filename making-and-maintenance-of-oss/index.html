Nadia Eghbal</a> was a delight to read. I
had initially come across Eghbal&rsquo;s work through her <a href=https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/>research report for the
Ford
Foundation</a>,
but that piece seemed to be more geared towards raising awareness of open
source in boardrooms, whereas her latest book was a much more nuanced
discussion of open source.</p><p>The first half was basically describing the open source software, how it works,
and how it&rsquo;s maintained (with a healthy focus on GitHub). Despite being an open
source contributor for a while, I was surprised at some particularly lucid
thoughts here. Here are just two of them:</p><ol><li><p>This table classifying the &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; of open source projects:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>High User Growth</th><th>Low User Growth</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>High Contributor Growth</td><td>Federations (e.g. Rust)</td><td>Clubs (e.g. Astropy)</td></tr><tr><td>Low Contributor Growth</td><td>Stadiums (e.g. Babel)</td><td>Toys (e.g. ssh-chat)</td></tr></tbody></table></li><li><p>The idea of there being <em>two</em> economic goods in open source: the code itself
(which is what is consumed), and developer attention (which is how the code
is produced), the first of which is a positive externality of the latter.
These two goods have <em>very</em> different properties: the open source code is a
public good, whereas developer attention is a commons (of <em>tragedy of the
commons</em> fame).</p></li></ol><p>The second half of the book was much more enlightening to me: having discussed
why open source software gets created (&ldquo;for fun and street cred&rdquo; is basically
the short answer), Eghbal delves into how it is maintained - including thorny
topics like developer chemistry, governance structure, funding sources&mldr; all
issues that I feel the open source community is getting a better and better
grip on.</p><p>Now, what struck me was an interesting disconnect between the first and second
halves of the book.</p><p>The problems of <em>making</em> open source seem to be not so grievous: Eghbal even
acknowledges this, citing developer&rsquo;s &ldquo;intrinsic motivation&rdquo;, and pointing to
several examples of developers making open-source software just for fun. These
problems are generally solved because of the nature of open source software
itself.</p><p>However, the problems of <em>maintaining</em> open source seem startlingly similar to
those of almost any other kind of public good on the internet information
economy: I&rsquo;m thinking of things like Wikipedia, Sci-Hub, Hacker News &mdash; any
website or app that satisfies (2) above (e.g. in the case of Sci-Hub the
academic articles are offered to anyone for free, but the entire project is
held together by the PHP skills of <a href=https://sci-hub.tw/alexandra>one Kazakh
woman</a>).</p><p>I think Eghbal realizes that these problems aren&rsquo;t specific to just open
source, but rather are endemic to the internet information economy &mdash; she
concludes the book by meditating on the similarities of open source software
and online content more generally. Food for thought!</p></content><p><a href=https://www.georgeho.org/blog/open-source/>#open-source</a></p></main><footer><form action=https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/eigenfoo method=post target=popupwindow onsubmit='window.open("https://buttondown.email/eigenfoo","popupwindow")' class=embeddable-buttondown-form><label for=bd-email>Get my (monthly?) blog posts over email:</label><br><input type=email name=email id=bd-email placeholder=your@email.com>
